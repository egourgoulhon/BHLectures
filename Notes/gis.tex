\section{Introduction} \label{s:gis:intro}

Having investigated the properties of generic causal geodesics
in Schwarzschild spacetime in Chap.~\ref{s:ges}, we focus here on null
geodesics. The main interest of null geodesics is of course that they are
the carriers of information from the surroundings of the black hole to some
observer, in particular in the form of images.
We start by studying the general property of null geodesics in
Sec.~\ref{s:gis:null}, distinguishing the radial geodesics, from the non-radial
ones and focussing on the $r$-motion. Then in Sec.~\ref{s:gis:planar_trajectories},
we study of the $\ph$-motion and show that the trajectory of a given
null geodesic in the equatorial plane is fully integrable, via elliptic integrals.
In Sec.~\ref{s:gis:asymp} we compute the asymptotic direction taken by a
null geodesic emitted at a given point; this prepares the discussion of
images in Sec.~\ref{s:gis:images}.
The study of black hole images has received a tremendous boost after the release of the first observed image by the Event Horizon Telescope\index{Event Horizon Telescope} collaboration in 2019, that of the black hole M87* \cite{EHT19a}.
However, we differ the discussion of this image to the chapter regarding null
geodesics around a rotating black hole (Chap.~\ref{s:gik}), since the black hole
spin plays some role in the images and M87* is expected to be a fast rotator.

\section{Main properties of null geodesics} \label{s:gis:null}

We use the same notations as in Sec.~\ref{s:ges:geod_motion} of the preceding
chapter: $(\M, \w{g})$ is Schwarzschild spacetime, $(t,r,\th,\ph)$ are
Schwarzschild-Droste coordinates and
$\mathscr{P}$ is a particle, the worldline of which is a
geodesic $\Li$. The particle $\mathscr{P}$ is characterized by its
4-momentum $\w{p}$ and
$E$ and $L$ stand for the conserved energy and conserved angular momentum
along $\Li$ [cf.~Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:conserved_quantities})].


In all this chapter, we consider that $\Li$ is a \emph{null}
geodesic\index{null!geodesic}\index{geodesic!null --}, or equivalently that
$\mathscr{P}$ is a \emph{massless} particle, typically a photon\index{photon}.
As in Chap.~\ref{s:ges}, we assume that the coordinates $(\th,\ph)$ are chosen
so that $\Li$ lies in the hyperplane $\th=\pi/2$. Let us recall that
a geodesic of Schwarzschild spacetime lies necessarily in some hypersurface, which
can be chosen to be the hyperplane $\th=\pi/2$ without any loss of generality
(cf. Sec.~\ref{s:ges:fiom}).

\subsection{Equations to be solved}

In terms of Schwarzschild-Droste coordinates, the geodesic motion of $\mathscr{P}$ is governed by Eqs.~(\ref{e:ges:dot_t}), (\ref{e:ges:dot_ph}) and (\ref{e:ges:dot_r_square})
with $\mu=0$ (massless particle):
\be \label{e:ges:dot_t_null}
   \encadre{ \frac{\D t}{\D \lambda} = E \left(1 - \frac{2m}{r} \right) ^{-1} } ,
\ee
\be \label{e:ges:dot_ph_null}
   \encadre{ \frac{\D\ph}{\D\lambda} = \frac{L}{r^2}  },
\ee
\be \label{e:ges:dot_r_square_null}
   \encadre{ \left( \frac{\D r}{\D \lambda} \right) ^2
         + \frac{L^2}{r^2}
         \left( 1 - \frac{2m}{r} \right) = E^2 }.
\ee
Let us recall that the variable $\lambda$ with respect to which these differential equations
hold
is the affine parameter associated with the 4-momentum $\w{p}$ of $\mathscr{P}$:
$\w{p} = \D\w{x}/\D\lambda$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:def_lambda})] and that
$\lambda$ increases towards the future,
$\w{p}$ being always future-directed (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:ges:eq_to_be_solved}).

\subsection{Radial null geodesics} \label{s:gis:radial}

Let us first discuss the case of radial geodesics, which are characterized by $L=0$.
Equation (\ref{e:ges:dot_ph_null}) yields immediately $\ph=\mathrm{const}$,
while Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:dot_r_square_null}) simplifies drastically:
\be \label{e:ges:dot_r_null_radial}
    \frac{\D r}{\D \lambda} = \pm E ,
\ee
the solution of which is immediate:
\be \label{e:ges:r_lambda_radial_null}
    r = \pm E\lambda + r_0 ,
\ee
where $r_0$ is some constant.
Moreover, writing $\D t/\D\lambda = \D t/\D r \times \D r/\D\lambda$
and combining Eqs.~(\ref{e:ges:dot_t_null}) and (\ref{e:ges:dot_r_null_radial}),
we get
\be \label{e:gis:dtdr_radial_geod}
    \frac{\D t}{\D r} = \pm \left(1 - \frac{2m}{r} \right) ^{-1} .
\ee
We recognize the equation governing the radial null geodesics
$\Li^{\rm out}_{(u,\th,\ph)}$ and $\Li^{\rm in}_{(v,\th,\ph)}$
obtained in
Sec.~\ref{s:sch:rad_null_geod} [Eq.~(\ref{e:sch:Dt_Dr_radial_null_geod})],
the solution of which is given by Eq.~(\ref{e:sch:t_r_radial_null_geod}):
\be
   \encadre{ t = \pm r \pm 2 m \ln \left| \frac{r}{2m} - 1 \right| + \mathrm{const} }.
\ee

\begin{remark}
Since $\lambda$ is an affine parameter and $E$ is constant,
Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:r_lambda_radial_null})
shows explicitly that $r$ is another affine parameter along radial null
geodesics of Schwarzschild spacetime --- a feature that we had already
obtained in Sec.~\ref{s:sch:rad_null_geod}.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
The radial null geodesics $\Li^{{\rm out},\Hor}_{(\th,\ph)}$ discussed
in Sec.~\ref{s:sch:radial_null_IEF} have $L=0$, but they
are not recovered from Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:dtdr_radial_geod}), since the latter is based on Schwarzschild-Droste coordinates
$(t,r,\th,\ph)$ and the $\Li^{{\rm out},\Hor}_{(\th,\ph)}$'s are the null geodesic generators
of the event horizon $\Hor$, which does not lie in the Schwarzschild-Droste domain.
\end{remark}

Some radial null geodesics of Schwarzschild spacetime are plotted in
Fig.~\ref{f:sch:rad_null_geod} in terms of the Schwarzschild-Droste coordinates
and in Fig.~\ref{f:sch:rad_null_geod_EF} in terms of the ingoing Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates.



\subsection{Generic null geodesics: effective potential}
\label{s:gis:null_eff_pot}

Having discussed the case $L=0$ in the preceding section, we focus now on the
case $L\not= 0$ (``generic'' case). We may then
consider along the geodesic $\Li$ the affine parameter
\be
   \encadre{ \tilde{\lambda} := |L| \lambda },
\ee
instead of $\lambda$, the latter being the affine parameter associated with the 4-momentum $\w{p}$
via Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:def_lambda}).
Since $L$ is a non-vanishing constant along a geodesic, the above formula
does define a new affine parameter. The absolute value ensures that
$\tilde{\lambda}$ is increasing towards the future, as $\lambda$, whatever
the sign of $L$. Note that $\tilde{\lambda}$ has the same
dimension as $L$, i.e. a squared length, given that $\lambda$ is dimensionless
(cf. Sec.~\ref{s:ges:eq_to_be_solved}).
In terms of $\tilde{\lambda}$,
the differential system (\ref{e:ges:dot_t_null})-(\ref{e:ges:dot_r_square_null})
becomes
\be \label{e:ges:dot_t_null_b}
   \encadre{\frac{\D t}{\D \tilde{\lambda}} = b^{-1} \left(1 - \frac{2m}{r} \right) ^{-1} },
\ee
\be \label{e:ges:dot_ph_null_b}
   \encadre{ \frac{\D\ph}{\D\tilde{\lambda}} = \frac{\eps_L}{r^2} } ,
\ee
\be \label{e:ges:dot_r_square_null_b}
   \encadre{ \left( \frac{\D r}{\D\tilde{\lambda}} \right) ^2
        + U(r) = \frac{1}{b^2} },
\ee
where
\be \label{e:ges:def_b}
    \encadre{b := \frac{|L|}{E}} ,
\ee
\be \label{e:gis:def_epsilon_L}
    \eps_L := \frac{L}{|L|} = \operatorname{sgn} L
\ee
and
\be \label{e:ges:eff_pot_null}
    \encadre{ U(r) := \frac{1}{r^2} \left( 1 - \frac{2m}{r} \right) }.
\ee
As for the timelike case (cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:1d_motion_timelike})),
we note that Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:dot_r_square_null_b})
has the shape of the first integral of the
1-dimensional motion of a non-relativist particle in the
\defin{effective potential}\index{effective!potential!null geodesic}
$U(r)$. The main difference is that $U(r)$ does not depend on $L$, contrary
to the effective potential $V_\ell(r)$ for timelike geodesics. Actually,
$U(r)$ is a function of $r$ and the black hole mass $m$ only.
We thus arrive at
\begin{prop}[characterization of null geodesics by the impact parameter]
A null geodesic $\Li$ is entirely characterized by the constants
$b$ and $\eps_L = \pm 1$.
As soon as $\Li$ has some part in
region $\M_{\rm I}$, then $E>0$ [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:E_positive_M_I})], so that
$b$, as defined by Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:def_b}), is finite and positive. It has
the dimension of a length and can be interpreted as the
\defin{impact parameter}\index{impact parameter} in the case of a
particle arising from infinity.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Let us consider that the massless
particle $\mathscr{P}$ arises from a point of coordinates $\theta=\pi/2$,
$r=r_0 \gg m$ and $\ph = \ph_0$.  Let us introduce
Cartesian coordinates $(x,y)$ in the plane $\theta=\pi/2$:
$x:=r\cos\ph$ and $y:=r\sin\ph$.
Without any loss of generality, we may
consider $|\ph_0| \ll 1$. For large values of $r$, the motion of
$\mathscr{P}$ is then essentially along the $x$-axis, with $\ph$ remaining small:
$y\simeq y_0$, where
$y_0 = r_0 \sin\ph_0 \simeq r_0 \ph_0$. The quantity
$|y_0|$ is the impact parameter.
Since $y=r\sin\ph\simeq r\ph$, we get from $y\simeq y_0$
the following relation
\[
    \ph \simeq \frac{y_0}{r} \qquad (r \gg m) .
\]
Deriving with respect to $t$ leads to
\be \label{e:ges:dphdt_approx}
    \derd{\ph}{t} \simeq - \frac{y_0}{r^2} \derd{r}{t}
                  \simeq \frac{y_0}{r^2}  \qquad (r \gg m) ,
\ee
where we have used $\D r / \D t = - 1$ for $r \gg m$. This last property is easy
to admit since
$r\gg m$ corresponds to the flat part of spacetime; however, it can be derived
rigorously by combining Eqs.~(\ref{e:ges:dot_t_null_b}) and
(\ref{e:ges:dot_r_square_null_b}) to evaluate $\D r / \D t$.
Now by combining Eqs.~(\ref{e:ges:dot_t_null_b}) and (\ref{e:ges:dot_ph_null_b}),
we have
\be
    \derd{\ph}{t} = \eps_L \frac{b}{r^2} \left( 1 - \frac{2m}{r} \right) .
\ee
For $r\gg m$, the right-hand side reduces to $\eps_L b/r^2$, so that the comparison
with (\ref{e:ges:dphdt_approx}) yields $\eps_L b = y_0$, i.e. $b = |y_0|$,
which proves that $b$ is the impact
parameter of the massless particle $\mathscr{P}$ with respect to the central
black hole.
\end{proof}

The effective potential $U(r)$ is plotted in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:eff_pot_null}.
It has no minimum and a maximum at $r=3m$, which is
\be \label{e:ges:U_max}
    U_{\rm max} = \frac{1}{27m^2} .
\ee
This extremum is a stationary position in $r$: it corresponds thus to a circular
orbit, usually called the
\defin{circular photon orbit}\index{photon!orbit!circular --}\index{orbit!photon --}\index{circular!photon orbit}
The set of all photon orbits (one per choice of equatorial plane) is often
called the \defin{photon sphere}\index{photon!sphere}\index{sphere!photon --}.
However, since it corresponds to a \emph{maximum} of the effective potential, the circular
orbit at $r=3m$ is an unstable orbit. So one should not imagine that a
Schwarzschild black hole is surrounded by any spherical shell of photons...


\subsection{Radial behavior of null geodesics} \label{s:gis:null_radial_behav}

For the sake of concreteness, in this section and the remaining ones, we
refer to the massless particle $\mathscr{P}$ as a ``photon''. In most applications, in
particular the astrophysical ones, $\mathscr{P}$ will indeed be a photon.
But one shall keep in mind that all results are valid for any other massless
particle.

Since the effective potential
$U(r)$ has no minimum, it does not offer any potential well,
as it is clear from Fig.~\ref{f:gis:eff_pot_null}. This is in sharp contrast
with the effective potential $V_\ell(r)$ for massive particle
(compare Fig.~\ref{f:ges:eff_pot_bound}). Hence there are no bound orbits
for photons\footnote{unless one counts as ``bound'' a worldline that terminates in the
black hole region}.

We can infer various types of photon worldlines from Fig.~\ref{f:gis:eff_pot_null}.
In view of the ``first integral'' (\ref{e:ges:dot_r_square_null_b}),
each photon worldline can be represented by a horizontal line of ordinate
$b^{-2}$ in this figure, which must lie above the curve $U(r)$
by the positive quantity $({\D r}/{\D\tilde{\lambda}})^2$. The region under the curve
$U(r)$ is thus excluded.

For an initially inward photon, i.e. a photon emitted with ${\D r}/{\D\tilde{\lambda}} < 0$
from a position $r=r_{\rm em}$, there are
two possibilities, depending on the values of $r_{\rm em}$ and
of the impact parameter $b$:
\begin{itemize}
\item if $r_{\rm em} > 3 m$ and $b$ is large enough to fulfill $b^{-2} < U_{\rm max}$
(e.g. trajectory no.~1 in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:eff_pot_null}), the photon
``bounces'' on the potential barrier constituted by $U(r)$
at some minimal value  $r_{\rm p}$ of $r$ --- the \defin{periastron}\index{periastron},
which is given by  $U(r_{\rm p}) = b^{-2}$, or equivalently by
\be \label{e:ges:r_per_null}
  r_{\rm p}^3 - b^2\, r_{\rm p} + 2 m b^2 = 0, \quad r_{\rm p} > 3 m.
\ee
Equation~(\ref{e:ges:dot_r_square_null_b})
implies then
\be
    \left. \frac{\D r}{\D\tilde{\lambda}} \right| _{r = r_{\rm p}} = 0 .
\ee
Actually, $\D r / \D\tilde{\lambda}$ changes sign at $r = r_{\rm p}$ and
the photon subsequently moves away from the black hole for ever (cf. geodesic
no.~1 in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:null_geod}). We may call
such a worldline a \defin{scattering trajectory}\index{scattering}.
\item if $r_{\rm em} < 3 m$ (e.g. trajectory
no.~4 in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:eff_pot_null}) or $b$ is small enough to fulfill $b^{-2} > U_{\rm max}$ (e.g. trajectory
no.~2 in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:eff_pot_null}) the photon
is not halted by the potential barrier constituted by $U(r)$. It then reaches arbitrarily
small values of $r$ and is eventually absorbed by the black hole ($r < 2m$)
(cf. geodesic no.~2 in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:null_geod}).
\end{itemize}

For an initially outward photon, i.e. a photon emitted with ${\D r}/{\D\tilde{\lambda}} > 0$,
one has necessarily $r_{\rm em}>2m$ according to the result obtained in Sec.~\ref{s:ges:eq_to_be_solved}
and there are then two possible outcomes:

\begin{itemize}
\item if $r_{\rm em} > 3 m$ (e.g. trajectory
no.~1 in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:eff_pot_null}) or
$b$ is small enough to fulfill $b^{-2} > U_{\rm max}$ (e.g. trajectory
no.~3 in Figs.~\ref{f:gis:eff_pot_null}), the photon escapes to infinity
(cf. geodesic no.~3 in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:null_geod});
\item if $2m < r_{\rm em} < 3 m$ and $b^{-2} < U_{\rm max}$ (e.g. trajectory
no.~4 in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:eff_pot_null}), the photon ``bounces'' on the left
side of the potential barrier, reaching a maximal value $r_{\rm a}$ of $r$
--- the \defin{apoastron}\index{apoastron},
which is given by  $U(r_{\rm a}) = b^{-2}$, or equivalently by
\be \label{e:ges:r_apo_null}
   r_{\rm a}^3 - b^2\, r_{\rm a} + 2 m b^2 = 0, \quad r_{\rm a} < 3 m.
\ee
The photon moves subsequently towards the black hole and
is absorbed by it (cf. geodesic no.~4 in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:null_geod}).
\end{itemize}

The critical value of the impact parameter $b$ separating the cases discussed
above is determined by $b_{\rm c}^{-2} = U_{\rm max}$.
Given the value (\ref{e:ges:U_max}) of $U_{\rm max}$, we get
\be \label{e:ges:b_crit}
    \encadre{b_{\rm c} = 3\sqrt{3} \, m \simeq 5.196152\, m }.
\ee

The above discussion leads us to
\begin{prop}[Behaviour of $r$ along a null geodesics]
Along any null geodesic of Schwarzschild spacetime, the areal coordinate $r$
either is a monotonic function or has a single turning point. In the latter case,
if the turning point corresponds to a minimum of $r$ (a \emph{periastron}, which can occur
only for $r>3m$), the null geodesic escapes to infinity, while if the turning
point corresponds to a maximum of $r$ (an \emph{apoastron}, which can occur only for $2m<r<3m$), the
null geodesic terminates at the central singularity ($r=0$).
\end{prop}
Note that for $r<2m$, i.e. in the black hole region, $r$
is always a monotonic function, since it has been demonstrated in
Sec.~\ref{s:ges:eq_to_be_solved} that $r(\lambda)$ is strictly
decreasing. The impossibility of a turning point for $r<2m$ can also be
graphically inferred from Fig.~\ref{f:gis:eff_pot_null}, which shows
that the effective potential $U(r)$ is negative for $r<2m$,
preventing the turning point condition $U(r) = b^{-2}$ to hold.


For $b > b_{\rm c}$, the explicit expression of the periastron radius
$r_{\rm p}$ (or the apoastron radius $r_{\rm a}$)
is obtained by solving the cubic equation (\ref{e:ges:r_per_null})
(or (\ref{e:ges:r_apo_null}), which is the same cubic equation, except for
the range of the solution). Fortunately Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:r_per_null})
is a depressed\footnote{A \emph{depressed} cubic equation is a polynomial equation
of the type $x^3 + p x + q = 0$.} cubic equation, which makes
it simpler to solve. For $b > b_{\rm c}$, its discriminant $-(4 p^3 + 27 q^2)$
is positive, which
implies that it admits three distinct real roots. Two of them are positive
and are precisely $r_{\rm p}$ and $r_{\rm a}$. The third root is negative,
since the product of the roots is $-2mb^2 < 0$; it has therefore no
physical significance. The roots of the generic depressed cubic
equation $x^3 + p x + q = 0$ can be expressed via Viète's formulas\index{Viète!formulas}:
\be \label{e:gis:Viete}
    x_k = 2 \sqrt{-\frac{p}{3}} \cos \left[ \frac{1}{3}\,  \arccos\left(
        \frac{3 q}{2 p} \sqrt{-\frac{3}{p}} \right) + \frac{2 k\pi}{3} \right],
        \qquad k \in \{0, 1, 2\} .
\ee
In the present case, $p= - b^2$, $q = 2 m b^2$
and $r_{\rm p}$ (resp. $r_{\rm a}$) corresponds to $k=0$
(resp. $k=2$), so that we obtain
\be \label{e:ges:sol_r_per}
  \encadre{  r_{\rm p} = \frac{2 b}{\sqrt{3}} \cos\left[\frac{\pi}{3}
        - \frac{1}{3} \, \arccos\left(\frac{b_{\rm c}}{b}\right) \right] }.
\ee
\be \label{e:ges:sol_r_apo}
   \encadre{ r_{\rm a} = \frac{2 b}{\sqrt{3}} \cos\left[\frac{5\pi}{3}
        - \frac{1}{3} \, \arccos\left(\frac{b_{\rm c}}{b}\right) \right] }.
\ee
As a check, we note that for $b\gg b_{\rm c}$, Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:sol_r_per})
yields $r_{\rm p} \simeq 2b/\sqrt{3} \cos\left(\pi/3 -1/3 \times \pi/2 \right)
\simeq 2b/\sqrt{3} \cos(\pi/6) \simeq b$, as expected. Indeed, $b\gg b_{\rm c}$
implies $b \gg m$, so that the photon stays far from the black hole, a regime
in which the impact parameter coincides with the distance of closest approach:
$b \simeq r_{\rm p}$.

both. \textsl{[Figure produced with the notebook \ref{s:sam:ges_null_periastron}]}
}
\end{figure}

The variation of $r_{\rm p}$ and $r_{\rm a}$ with $b$ is plotted
in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:null_per_apo}. Note that $r_{\rm p} = r_{\rm a} = 3 m$
(the photon orbit) at the limit $b = b_{\rm c}$.
\begin{remark}
It is clear on Fig.~\ref{f:gis:null_per_apo} that, for the same value of $b$,
$r_{\rm a} \leq r_{\rm p}$, which may seem contradictory with the apoastron
corresponding to the largest distance from the center and the periastron to
the distance of closest approach.
However, one shall keep in mind that the apoastron and the periastron always refer to different null
geodesics: geodesics with an apoastron lie below the photon sphere ($r=3m$), while those
with a periastron are always outside it. A null geodesic can of course cross
the photon sphere (examples are geodesics 2 and 3 on Figs.~\ref{f:gis:eff_pot_null}
and \ref{f:gis:null_geod}), but then it has neither an apoastron nor a periastron.
\end{remark}

\section{Trajectories of null geodesics in the equatorial plane} \label{s:gis:planar_trajectories}

In all this section, we assume $L\not = 0$, i.e. we consider non-radial
null geodesics, the radial case having been discussed in Sec.~\ref{s:gis:radial}.

Let us first recall the generic property of causal geodesics in Schwarzschild
spacetime established in Sec.~\ref{s:ges:eq_to_be_solved} : for $L\not=0$,
the azimuthal angle coordinate $\ph$ has no turning point: it is either always increasing
towards the future
($L>0$) or always decreasing towards the future ($L<0$).
\begin{remark}
We recover the above property from Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:dot_ph_null_b}):
$\D\ph/\D\tilde{\lambda} = \eps_L/r^2$, given that
$\eps_L = \operatorname{sgn} L$ and $\tilde{\lambda}$ increases towards
the future.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Differential equation and fundamental cubic polynomial}
\label{s:gis:cubic_poly}

The equation governing the $(r,\ph)$-part of a null geodesic, named
\emph{trajectory in the orbital plane} in Sec.~\ref{s:ges:trajectories},
is the generic differential equation (\ref{e:ges:DuDph_trajectories})
with $\mu$ (the particle's mass) set to zero and the ratio $E^2/L^2$ replaced
by $1/b^2$ [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:def_b})]:
\be \label{e:gis:du_dphi_null}

where $u := m/r$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:def_u})] and $P_b(u)$ stands for the cubic
polynomial
\be \label{e:ges:def_Pb_u}

\begin{remark}
Of course, Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:du_dphi_null}) can be recovered by combining
Eqs.~(\ref{e:ges:dot_ph_null_b}), (\ref{e:ges:dot_r_square_null_b})
and (\ref{e:ges:eff_pot_null}).
\end{remark}

The graph of the polynomial $P_b$ is shown in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:polynomial_b_u}
for selected values of $b$. Note that along a null geodesic, one must
have $u>0$ and
$P_b(u) \geq 0$. The first condition follows from the very definition of
$u$ as $m/r$, while the second one is a direct consequence of
Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:du_dphi_null}).

\end{figure}

By Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:du_dphi_null}), the zeros of the polynomial $P_b$
correspond to points at which $\D u /\D\ph = 0$. They are thus stationary points
for $u$, and hence for $r$. This can only occur at the circular photon
orbit $r = \mathrm{const} = 3 m$ (then $b=b_{\rm c}$)
or at the periastron or apoastron discussed
in Sec.~\ref{s:gis:null_radial_behav} (then $b > b_{\rm c}$).
The zeros of $P_b$ are governed by its
discriminant, which is
\be
    \Delta = 4 \frac{m^4}{b^4} \left( \frac{b^2}{m^2} - 27 \right) .
\ee
One may distinguish three cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Delta>0$ $\iff$ $b > \sqrt{27} m = b_{\rm c}$: $P_b$ has three distinct
real zeros (cf. the green and cyan curves
in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:polynomial_b_u}); one of them, $u_{\rm n}$ say, is
negative, and hence unphysical (since $u:=m/r >0$),
while the two other ones are positive, being nothing but
\be \label{e:ges:def_u_per_apo}
    u_{\rm p} = \frac{m}{r_{\rm p}} \qquad\mbox{and}\qquad
    u_{\rm a} = \frac{m}{r_{\rm a}} ,
\ee
where $r_{\rm p}$ and $r_{\rm a}$ are the periastron and apoastron radii given by
Eqs.~(\ref{e:ges:sol_r_per})-(\ref{e:ges:sol_r_apo}).
\item $\Delta=0$ $\iff$ $b = b_{\rm c}$: $P_b$
has a double zero: $u_{\rm a} = u_{\rm p} =1/3$ and a negative zero:
$u_{\rm n}=-1/6$ (cf. red curve
in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:polynomial_b_u}); only the first
one is physical and correspond to $r=3m$.
\item $\Delta<0$ $\iff$ $b < b_{\rm c}$:
$P_b$ has one real negative zero, $u_{\rm n}$, and two complex zeros
(cf. blue and magenta curves in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:polynomial_b_u}),
so that $P_b(u)$ never vanishes
for physical values of $u$, which are real positive.
\end{itemize}

Since they will be required in what follows, let us
find explicit expressions for the real zeros of the polynomial $P_b$.
The equation $P_b(u) = 0$ can be brought to a depressed form (no square term)
by the change of variable $u = x + 1/6$. We get
\be \label{e:gis:zeros_Pb_eq_in_x}
    x^3 - \frac{1}{12} x + \frac{m^2}{2b^2} - \frac{1}{108} = 0 .
\ee
We shall discuss separately the cases $b>b_{\rm c}$ and $b<b_{\rm c}$.

$b = b_{\rm c} \simeq 5.196\, m$.

\subsubsection{Zeros of $P_b$ for $b\geq b_{\rm c}$}

For $b>b_{\rm c}$, we can express the solutions of Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:zeros_Pb_eq_in_x})
via Viète's formulas \eqref{e:gis:Viete}
with $p = -1/12$ and $q = m^2/(2b^2) - 1/108$.
We then get the zeros of $P_b$ as
\[
    u_k = \frac{1}{3} \cos \left[ \frac{1}{3}
        \arccos \left( 1 - 2 \frac{b_{\rm c}^2}{b^2} \right) + \frac{2 k \pi}{3} \right]
        + \frac{1}{6},
        \qquad k \in \{0, 1, 2\} .
\]
Using the identity $\arccos(1 - 2 x^2) = 2\arcsin x$ and noticing
that $u_1 < 0$, which implies $u_1 = u_{\rm n}$, and $u_ 0 \geq u_2$, which
implies $u_0 = u_{\rm a}$ and $u_2 = u_{\rm p}$,
we arrive at
\begin{subequations}
\label{e:gis:zeros_Pbu}
\begin{align}
  &  \encadre{u_{\rm n} = \frac{1}{3}\cos\left[ \frac{2}{3} \arcsin\left(
   \frac{b_{\rm c}}{b}\right) + \frac{2\pi}{3}\right] + \frac{1}{6} } \qquad (b \geq b_{\rm c}) \label{e:gis:u_n_b_gt_bc}\\[1ex]
 & \encadre{ u_{\rm p} = \frac{1}{3}\cos\left[ \frac{2}{3} \arcsin\left(
   \frac{b_{\rm c}}{b}\right) + \frac{4\pi}{3}\right] + \frac{1}{6} }
            \qquad (b \geq b_{\rm c}) \label{e:gis:u_per_b}  \\[1ex]
 & \encadre{ u_{\rm a} = \frac{1}{3}\cos\left[ \frac{2}{3} \arcsin\left(
   \frac{b_{\rm c}}{b}\right) \right] + \frac{1}{6} }  \qquad (b \geq b_{\rm c}) .
   \label{e:gis:u_apo_b}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
These zeros are plotted in terms of $b$ on Fig.~\ref{f:gis:u_per_apo_neg}.
Note the ordering
\be \label{e:gis:order_u_zeros}
    -\frac{1}{6} \leq u_{\rm n} < 0 < u_{\rm p} \leq \frac{1}{3}
    \leq u_{\rm a} < \frac{1}{2} ,
\ee
with the inequalities $\leq$ being saturated for $b = b_{\rm c}$.
Note also that
\be \label{e:gis:lim_b_inf_u_zeros}
    \lim_{b\to +\infty} u_{\rm n} = 0,\qquad
    \lim_{b\to +\infty} u_{\rm p} = 0,\qquad\mbox{and}\qquad
    \lim_{b\to +\infty} u_{\rm a} = \frac{1}{2} .
\ee

It is easy to express two of the zeros in terms of the third one. For instance,
let us pick $u_{\rm p}$. From $P_b(u_{\rm p}) = 0$, we have immediately
$b^2/m^2 = - 2 u_{\rm p}^3 + u_{\rm p}^2$. If we substitute this expression
for $b^2/m^2$ into $P_b(u)$, we get
\bea
    P_b(u) = 0 & \iff &  2 u^3 - u^2 - 2 u_{\rm p}^3 + u_{\rm p}^2 = 0  \nonumber \\
    & \iff & (u - u_{\rm p})\left[ 2 (u^2 + u_{\rm p} u + u_{\rm p}^2)
    - (u + u_{\rm p}) \right] = 0  \nonumber \\
    & \iff & (u - u_{\rm p})\left[ 2 u^2 + (2 u_{\rm p} - 1) u
      + u_{\rm p} (2 u_{\rm p} - 1) \right] = 0 . \nonumber
\eea
The two zeros different from $u_{\rm p}$ of this equation, namely
$u_{\rm n}$ and $u_{\rm a}$, must then obey
\[
    2 u^2 + (2 u_{\rm p} - 1) u
      + u_{\rm p} (2 u_{\rm p} - 1)  = 0 .
\]
Solving this quadratic equation leads to the sought expressions:
\begin{subequations}
\label{e:gis:una_up}
\begin{align}
u_{\rm n} & = \frac{1}{4} \left( 1 - 2 u_{\rm p}
    - \sqrt{(1 - 2 u_{\rm p} ) (1 + 6 u_{\rm p} )} \right) \\
u_{\rm a} & = \frac{1}{4} \left( 1 - 2 u_{\rm p}
    + \sqrt{(1 - 2 u_{\rm p} ) (1 + 6 u_{\rm p} )} \right) .
\end{align}
\end{subequations}


\subsubsection{Real zero of $P_b$ for $b<b_{\rm c}$}

As mentioned above, for $b<b_{\rm c}$, $P_b$ has only one real zero, $u_{\rm n}$,
which is negative. Its value is obtained by means of
\emph{Viète's substitution}\index{Viète!substitution},
which consists in setting $x = w + 1/(36 w)$ in Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:zeros_Pb_eq_in_x}),
thereby turning it into a quadratic equation for $w^3$. Solving the latter yields
\be \label{e:gis:u_n_b_lt_bc}
   \encadre{ u_{\rm n} = \frac{1}{6} \left[ 1
    - \left( \frac{b_{\rm c}}{b} - \sqrt{ \frac{b_{\rm c}^2}{b^2} - 1 } \right) ^{2/3}
    - \left( \frac{b_{\rm c}}{b} - \sqrt{ \frac{b_{\rm c}^2}{b^2} - 1 } \right) ^{- 2/3}
    \right] } \qquad (b < b_{\rm c}).
\ee
$u_{\rm n}$ is plotted as a function of $b$ in the left part of
Fig.~\ref{f:gis:u_per_apo_neg}. Note that
\be \label{e:gis:range_un_b_lt_bc}
    u_{\rm n} < - \frac{1}{6}, \qquad
    \lim_{b\to b_{\rm c}^-} u_{\rm n} = - \frac{1}{6}
     \qquad\mbox{and}\qquad \lim_{b\to 0} u_{\rm n} = - \infty .
\ee
The last limit results from the expansion of Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:u_n_b_lt_bc}),
which yields
$u_{\rm n} \sim - (2b_{\rm c}/b)^{2/3} / 6$ when $b\to 0$.
Observe also from Fig.~\ref{f:gis:u_per_apo_neg} the smooth transition
with the value of $u_{\rm n}$ for $b\geq b_{\rm c}$, which is given by
Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:u_n_b_gt_bc}).

\begin{hist}
As mentioned in the historical note on p.~\pageref{h:ges:geod},
the equations of geodesic motion in Schwarzschild metric have been first derived
by Karl Schwarzschild\index[pers]{Schwarzschild, K.} in January 1916 \cite{Schwa1916} and
Johannes Droste\index[pers]{Droste, J.} in May 1916 \cite{Drost1917}, but these two
authors focussed on the \emph{timelike} case (orbit of a massive particle or a ``planet'').
It seems that the first explicit writing of the equations governing
\emph{null} geodesics is due to Ludwig Flamm\index[pers]{Flamm, L.} in September
1916 \cite{Flamm1916}. In particular, Flamm derived\footnote{The link
between Flamm's notations and ours is $\alpha=2m$, $R=r$, $x=u/m$ and $\Delta=b$.}
Eqs.~(\ref{e:ges:dot_t_null}),
(\ref{e:ges:dot_ph_null}) and a combination of Eqs.~(\ref{e:ges:dot_t_null}) and (\ref{e:ges:dot_r_square_null}). He also derived
Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:du_dphi_null}) governing the trajectories in the equatorial plane,
as well as Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:r_per_null}) giving the periastron.
Regarding the solutions of these equations, he got only approximate ones, to
the second order in $m/b$ and recover Einstein's famous result for the
deflection of light by the Sun.
For details about early studies of null geodesics in Schwarzschild spacetime,
see Ref.~\cite{Eisen87}.
\end{hist}

\subsection{Critical null geodesics} \label{s:gis:crit_geod}

For $b=b_{\rm c} = 3\sqrt{3}\, m$, the differential equation (\ref{e:gis:du_dphi_null})
can be integrated by means of elementary functions. Indeed, one has then
$P_b(u) = (u - 1/3)^2 (2u + 1/3)$ and Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:du_dphi_null})
is equivalent to
\be \label{e:ges:dphi_du_null_bcrit}
    \frac{\D\ph}{\D u} = \pm \frac{1}{\left|u - \frac{1}{3}\right|
        \sqrt{2u+\frac{1}{3}}} .
\ee
This equation can be easily integrated by noticing that
\be \label{e:ges:primitive_crit_geod}
    \frac{1}{(1-x)\sqrt{x}} = \begin{cases}
       \displaystyle 2 \frac{\D}{\D x} \left( \artanh \sqrt{x} \right) \quad \mbox{for}\ x\in(0,1)\\[2ex]
       \displaystyle 2 \frac{\D}{\D x} \left( \arcoth \sqrt{x} \right) \quad \mbox{for}\ x\in(1,+\infty) .
    \end{cases}
\ee
We thus perform the change of variable $x=2u + 1/3$ and treat separately
two cases : $u<1/3 \iff x\in (1/3,1)$ and $u>1/3 \iff x\in (1,+\infty)$.
We call geodesics in the first case
\defin{external critical null geodesics}\index{external!critical null geodesic}\index{critical!null geodesic!external --},
since $u<1/3\iff r > 3 m$, and those in the second case
\defin{internal critical null geodesics}\index{internal!critical null geodesic}\index{critical!null geodesic!internal --},
since $u>1/3 \iff r < 3m$. Note that the qualifiers \emph{external} and \emph{internal}  refer
to the photon sphere $r=3 m$ discussed in Sec.~\ref{s:gis:null_eff_pot}, and
\emph{not} to the black hole region ($r<2m$).

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{External critical null geodesics} \label{s:gis:extern_crit_geod}

For $u<1/3$, $x\in(1/3, 1)$, so that the first line of Eq.\eqref{e:ges:primitive_crit_geod}
is relevant and Eq.~\eqref{e:ges:dphi_du_null_bcrit} is integrated to
\be \label{e:ges:ph_u_crit_null_geod}
    \ph = \pm 2 \artanh \sqrt{2u + \frac{1}{3}} + \ph_0 ,
\ee
where $\ph_0$ is some integration constant. This relation is easily inverted
to
\be \label{e:ges:u_ph_crit_null_geod}
    u = \frac{1}{2}  \tanh^2 \left(\frac{\ph - \ph_0}{2} \right) - \frac{1}{6} .
\ee
Moving back to $r = m/u$, we obtain the equation of the external critical
null geodesic in polar form:
\be \label{e:ges:null_r_phi_tanh}
   \encadre{ r = \frac{2m}{\tanh^2 \left(\frac{\ph - \ph_0}{2} \right) - \frac{1}{3}} }.
\ee
The constant $\ph_0$ can be related to the asymptotic value $\ph_\infty$ of $\ph$
when $r\to +\infty$ by setting $u=0$ in Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:u_ph_crit_null_geod});
we get, using the identity $\artanh x = 1/2\ln[(1+x)/(1-x)]$,
\be \label{e:ges:null_ph_0_ph_inf}
    \ph_0 = \ph_\infty \pm \ph_*,\quad\mbox{with}\quad
    \ph_* := \ln\left(\frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{\sqrt{3} - 1}\right)
    \simeq 1.316958.
\ee

The function $r(\ph)$, as given by Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:null_r_phi_tanh}), is
depicted on Fig.~\ref{f:gis:null_r_phi_bcrit} (blue curve).
The region $\ph_0-\ph_* < \ph < \ph_0 + \ph_*$ is excluded, since
Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:null_r_phi_tanh}) would yield $r<0$. For $\ph > \ph_0 + \ph_*$,
$r(\ph)$ is a decaying
function, which corresponds to the
plus sign in Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:ph_u_crit_null_geod}) and to the minus sign in
Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:null_ph_0_ph_inf}): $\ph_0 = \ph_\infty - \ph_*$.
Figure~\ref{f:gis:null_b_crit_from_inf_L_pos} shows such a null geodesic with
$\ph_\infty=0$, which implies $\ph_0 = - \ph_*$ and $\ph>0$.
When $\ph\to +\infty$, the geodesic rolls up indefinitely onto the photon
orbit discussed in Sec.~\ref{s:gis:null_eff_pot}; this
behavior corresponds to the horizontal asymptote at $r=3m$ in
the right part of Fig.~\ref{f:gis:null_r_phi_bcrit}.
Note that the geodesic approaches very fast the photon orbit, only a single
path round to it being graphically visible in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:null_b_crit_from_inf_L_pos}.
This is because the asymptotic expansion of relation~\eqref{e:ges:null_r_phi_tanh} is
$r\sim 3m(1+ 6\mathrm{e}^{-\ph})$ when $\ph\to+\infty$.

It is worth stressing that Fig.~\ref{f:gis:null_b_crit_from_inf_L_pos} describes both (i) the trace
in the $(x,y)$-plane of a
geodesic with $L>0$ (so that $\ph$ increases towards the future, cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:dot_ph_null})) arising from $r\to + \infty$
and spiralling inwards to the photon orbit
and (ii) the trace of a geodesic with $L<0$ (so that $\ph$ decays towards the future)
arising from $r=r_{\rm em} > 3 m$, $\ph=\ph_{\rm em}>0$,
spiralling outwards and escaping to $r\to +\infty$ as $\ph\to 0$. Had we restored the
$t$ dimension perpendicular to the $(x,y)$-plane in a 3d plot, these two geodesics would have
clearly appeared distinct.

It obeys Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:null_r_phi_tanh}) with $\ph_0 = -\ph_*$ and $\ph\in(0,+\infty)$
(right branch of the blue curve in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:null_r_phi_bcrit}).

\textsl{[Figure produced with the notebook \ref{s:sam:ges_null_critical_geod}]}
}
\end{figure}

On the contrary, for $\ph < \ph_0 - \ph_*$,
$r(\ph)$ is an increasing
function, as it is clear on the left part of the blue curve in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:null_r_phi_bcrit}.
This corresponds to the
minus sign in Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:ph_u_crit_null_geod}) and to the plus sign in
Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:null_ph_0_ph_inf}): $\ph_0 = \ph_\infty + \ph_*$.
A null geodesic of this type is depicted in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:null_b_crit_from_inf_L_neg}.
It has $\ph_\infty = 0$, so that $\ph_0 = \ph_*$ and $\ph < 0$.
As for Fig.~\ref{f:gis:null_b_crit_from_inf_L_pos}, the curve depicted in
Fig.~\ref{f:gis:null_b_crit_from_inf_L_neg} can be interpreted as the trace
in the $(x,y)$-plane of two distinct
geodesics: one with $L<0$ arising from $r\to + \infty$
and spiralling inwards to the photon orbit when $\ph\to -\infty$
and another one with $L>0$
arising from $r=r_{\rm em} > 3 m$, $\ph=\ph_{\rm em}<0$,
spiralling outwards and escaping to $r\to +\infty$ as $\ph\to 0$.

\subsubsection{Internal critical null geodesics}

Let us now consider the ``internal'' case: $r< 3m \iff u>1/3$.
This implies $x\in (1,+\infty)$ in Eq.~\eqref{e:ges:primitive_crit_geod},
so that Eq.~\eqref{e:ges:dphi_du_null_bcrit} is integrated to
\be \label{e:ges:null_r_phi_coth}
    \encadre{ r = \frac{2m}{\coth^2 \left(\frac{\ph - \ph_0}{2} \right) - \frac{1}{3}} }.
\ee
Again, $\ph_0$ is an integration constant. But this time, it cannot be determined by the
value of $\ph$ when $r\to +\infty$ since we are in the case $r<3m$.
The function $r(\ph)$ given by Eq.~\eqref{e:ges:null_r_phi_coth} is plotted as the red
curve in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:null_r_phi_bcrit}. Contrary to external critical null geodesics, there
is no exclusion interval for $\ph$. However, $\ph$ cannot range from $-\infty$
to $+\infty$ along a given geodesic. Indeed, for $\ph=\ph_0$, one gets
$r=0$, which corresponds to the curvature singularity of the Schwarzschild black hole.
This is necessarily a termination point for any geodesic. The maximum
range of $\ph$ along an internal critical null geodesic is therefore
either $(-\infty,\ph_0)$ or $(\ph_0,+\infty)$.

An internal critical null geodesic with $\ph_0=0$ and $\ph\in(-\infty,0)$
is depicted in the left panel of Fig.~\ref{f:gis:null_b_crit_intern}.
For $\ph\to -\infty$, it rolls up indefinitely onto the photon
orbit ($r=3m$) from below. Again the approach to the photon orbit is exponentially
fast, the asymptotic expansion of relation \eqref{e:ges:null_r_phi_coth} being
$r\sim 3m (1 - 6 \mathrm{e}^\ph)$ when $\ph\to -\infty$.
The curve plotted in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:null_b_crit_intern} actually represents the trace in the equatorial plane of two
distinct geodesics: (i) a geodesic with $L>0$ arising
from $r=r_{\rm em} < 3 m$, $\ph=\ph_{\rm em}<0$ and inspiralling to the
central singularity as $\ph\to 0$ and (ii) a geodesic with $L<0$ arising from
$r = r_{\rm em} \in (2m,  3 m)$, $\ph=\ph_{\rm em}<0$ and spiralling outward
to the photon orbit as $\ph\to -\infty$. Note that for (ii), the
emission point must fulfill $r_{\rm em} > 2m$, i.e. must lie outside the black
hole region. Indeed, as shown in Sec.~\ref{s:ges:eq_to_be_solved}, along
any geodesic, $r$ must decrease towards the future in the black hole region.
Hence no null geodesic can be spiralling outwards there.

\begin{remark}
Actually, an outward spiralling critical null geodesic can emerge from
the region $r<2m$ when the latter corresponds to the \emph{white hole} region
in the extended Schwarzschild spacetime that will be discussed in Chap.~\ref{s:max}.
This explains why nothing in Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:null_r_phi_coth}) and
Fig.~\ref{f:gis:null_b_crit_intern} seems to prevent
this behavior.
\end{remark}

The right panel of Fig.~\ref{f:gis:null_b_crit_intern} corresponds to an
internal critical null geodesic with $\ph_0=0$ and $\ph\in(0, \infty)$.
For $\ph\to +\infty$, it rolls up indefinitely onto the photon
orbit ($r=3m$) from below. Again, the plotted curve describes two cases:
(i) a geodesic with $L<0$ arising
from $r=r_{\rm em} < 3 m$, $\ph=\ph_{\rm em}>0$ and inspiralling to the
central singularity as $\ph\to 0$ and (ii) a geodesic with $L>0$ arising from
$r = r_{\rm em} \in (2m,  3 m)$, $\ph=\ph_{\rm em}>0$ and spiralling outward
to the photon orbit as $\ph\to +\infty$.

\begin{hist}
The photon circular orbit at $r=3m$ has been exhibited by David Hilbert\index[pers]{Hilbert, D.}
in December 1916 \cite{Hilbe1917a,Hilbe1917b}. Hilbert also discussed the
critical null geodesics and their spirals
around the photon orbit, interpreting the latter as a Poincaré limit cycle
of the dynamical system governed by Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:du_dphi_null}).
Hilbert pointed out that ingoing null geodesics with an impact parameter
$b > b_{\rm c}$ are deflected (possibly looping
around the photon orbit if $b$ is close to $b_{\rm c}$) and escape to infinity,
while those with $b < b_{\rm c}$ cross the photon orbit and terminate on ``the circle
$r=2m$''. Hilbert claimed that null geodesics stop there, because
their (coordinate!) velocity vanishes\footnote{The coordinate velocity for
ingoing radial null geodesics is given by Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:dtdr_radial_geod}):
$dr/dt = - 1 + 2m/r$, which clearly vanishes at $r=2m$.}. We recover here the interpretation
of the $r=2m$ (coordinate) singularity as an impenetrable sphere advanced by Droste while discussing
timelike geodesics (cf. the historical note on p.~\pageref{h:ges:geod}). The distinction
between coordinate effects and physical ones was definitely not clear in the early
days of general relativity, even for great minds like Hilbert!
The same analysis and conclusions are found in the general relativity treatise
by Max von Laue\index[pers]{von Laue, M.} published in 1921 \cite{Laue1921}.

\subsection{Null geodesics with $b > b_{\rm c}$ and $r> 3m$} \label{s:gis:geod_b_gt_bc_out}

For $b \not= b_{\rm c}$, the differential equation~\eqref{e:gis:du_dphi_null} cannot be integrated
in terms of elementary functions. As we are going to see, it is integrable
though in terms of standard
functions of mathematical physics, namely elliptic integrals of the first kind.
As a first step, we rewrite Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:du_dphi_null}) as
\be \label{e:ges:dphi_du_null}
   \frac{\D\ph}{\D u} = \eps_L \eps_{\rm in} \frac{1}{\sqrt{P_b(u)}}  ,
\ee
where $\eps_L = \pm 1$ is the sign of the conserved angular momentum $L$
[cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:def_epsilon_L})] and $\eps_{\rm in} = \pm 1$ is
defined by
\be
    \eps_{\rm in} := \operatorname{sgn} \left( \frac{\D u}{\D\tlamb} \right) ,
\ee
i.e. $\eps_{\rm in} = +1$ if $u$ increases towards the future along $\Li$, or equivalently
if $r$ decreases towards the future along $\Li$ (\emph{inward} motion, hence the index ``in''),
and $\eps_{\rm in} = -1$ otherwise.
Let us recall that by vertue of the equation of motion (\ref{e:ges:dot_ph_null_b}),
$\epsilon_L$ gives the sign of $\D\ph/\D\tlamb$, so that the sign of
$\D\ph/\D u = \D\ph/\D\tlamb \times (\D u/\D\tlamb)^{-1}$ is $\eps_L \eps_{\rm in}$,
which justifies the factor $\eps_L \eps_{\rm in}$ in front of the positive
quantity $1/\sqrt{P_b(u)}$ in the right-hand side of Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:dphi_du_null}).

In this section, we consider null geodesics with $b>b_{\rm c}$ and outside
the photon sphere, i.e. geodesics similar to that labelled 1 in
Figs.~\ref{f:gis:eff_pot_null} and \ref{f:gis:null_geod}.
Each of these geodesics has a periastron, at $u = u_{\rm p}$, and obeys $u\to 0$
($r\to +\infty$) for both $\tlamb\to -\infty$ and
$\tlamb\to +\infty$. The general solution to the differential equation
(\ref{e:ges:dphi_du_null}) can be written as
\be \label{e:gis:ph_intPb_b_gt_bc}
    \ph = \ph_{\rm p} + \eps_L \eps_{\rm in}
        \int_{u_{\rm p}}^u \frac{\D\bar{u}}{\sqrt{P_b(\bar{u})}} ,
\ee
where $\ph_{\rm p}$ is the value of $\ph$ at the periastron.
We shall rewrite it as
\be \label{e:gis:ph_Phi_b_u}
    \encadre{ \ph = \ph_{\rm p} - \eps_L \eps_{\rm in} \Phi_b(u) },
\ee
where we have introduced the function
\be \label{e:gis:def_Phib_b_gt_bc}
   \encadre{  \Phi_b(u) := \int_u^{u_{\rm p}} \frac{\D\bar{u}}{\sqrt{P_b(\bar{u})}}
      = \int_u^{u_{\rm p}} \frac{\D\bar{u}}{\sqrt{2 \bar{u}^3 - \bar{u}^2 + (m/b)^2}} }
      \quad (b> b_{\rm c}) .
\ee
Since $u_{\rm p}$ is the function of $b$ given by Eq.~\eqref{e:gis:u_per_b},
the above relation defines uniquely a function of $u$ and $b$, which we consider
as a function of $u$ parameterized by $b$. Note that, since $u\leq u_{\rm p}$
(by definition of the periastron), one has $\Phi_b(u) \geq 0$.
To evaluate $\Phi_b(u)$, we rewrite it in terms of the three zeros
$(u_{\rm n}, u_{\rm p}, u_{\rm a})$ of $P_b$:
\be \label{e:gis:Phi_b_int_Pb_zeros}
  \Phi_b(u) = \int_u^{u_{\rm p}} \frac{\D\bar{u}}{
  \sqrt{2(\bar{u} - u_{\rm n})(u_{\rm p} - \bar{u})(u_{\rm a} - \bar{u})}} .
\ee
Let us perform the change of variable\footnote{It should be clear that the
variable $t$ introduced here has nothing to do with the Schwarzschild-Droste
coordinate $t$.}
\[
    t := \frac{\bar{u} - u_{\rm n}}{u_{\rm p} - u_{\rm n}}
    \quad\iff\quad
    \bar{u} = (u_{\rm p} - u_{\rm n}) t + u_{\rm n} .
\]
We get
\be
     \Phi_b(u) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2(u_{\rm a} - u_{\rm n})}}
     \int_{\frac{u - u_{\rm n}}{u_{\rm p} - u_{\rm n}}}^1
     \frac{\D t}{\sqrt{t(1-t)(1 - k^2 t)}} ,
\ee
where $k$ is the following constant:
\be \label{e:gis:def_k_modulus}
   \encadre{ k := \sqrt{\frac{u_{\rm p} - u_{\rm n}}{u_{\rm a} - u_{\rm n}}}
    = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{
       \sqrt{\sqrt{3}\cot\left(\frac{2}{3}\arcsin\left(\frac{b_{\rm c}}{b}\right)\right) + 1}}}
       \qquad (b > b_{\rm c}) ,
\ee
the second equality following from the expressions \eqref{e:gis:zeros_Pbu}
of $u_{\rm n}$, $u_{\rm p}$ and $u_{\rm a}$ in terms of $b$.



\begin{figure}

in expression (\ref{e:gis:Phib_elliptic_int}) for $\Phi_b(u)$.

}
\end{figure}

We can simplify further the integral via a second change of variable:
\[
    t = \sin^2 \vartheta \iff \vartheta = \arcsin\sqrt{t} .
\]
Note that $0<u\leq u_{\rm p}$ implies $0 < t \leq 1$, so that $0<\vartheta\leq \pi/2$.
Since $\D t = 2\sin\vartheta\cos\vartheta \, \D\vartheta = 2\sqrt{t(1-t)}\, \D\vartheta$,
we arrive immediately at
\be \label{e:gis:Phib_prov}
    \Phi_b(u) =  \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{u_{\rm a} - u_{\rm n}}} \int_{\phi_b(u)}^{\pi/2}
    \frac{\D\vartheta}{\sqrt{1 - k^2 \sin^2\vartheta}}  ,
\ee
where\footnote{Do no confuse the letter $\phi$ with the symbol used
for the coordinate $\ph$.}
\be \label{e:gis:phi_u_b}
   \encadre{ \phi_b(u) := \arcsin\sqrt{\frac{u - u_{\rm n}}{u_{\rm p} - u_{\rm n}}} }
     \qquad (b > b_{\rm c}) .
\ee
By splitting the integral according to $\int_\phi^{\pi/2} = \int_0^{\pi/2} - \int_0^\phi$,
we rewrite (\ref{e:gis:Phib_prov}) as
\be \label{e:gis:Phib_elliptic_int}
    \encadre{ \Phi_b(u) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{u_{\rm a} - u_{\rm n}}}
    \left[ K(k) - F\left( \phi_b(u) ,\; k\right) \right] } \qquad (b > b_{\rm c}) ,
\ee
where $F(\phi, k)$ is the
\defin{incomplete elliptic integral of the first kind}\index{incomplete!elliptic integral}\index{elliptic!integral!incomplete --} \cite{ByrdF71,GradsRGTJ115,AbramS72}:
\be \label{e:gis:def_incompl_elliptic_int}
    \encadre{ F(\phi, k) := \int_0^\phi \frac{\D\vartheta}{\sqrt{1 - k^2 \sin^2\vartheta}} }
\ee
and $K(k)$ is the \defin{complete elliptic integral of the first kind}\index{complete!elliptic integral}\index{elliptic!integral!complete --}:
\be \label{e:gis:def_K_complete}
    \encadre{
    K(k) := \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{\D\vartheta}{\sqrt{1 - k^2 \sin^2\vartheta}} = F\left(\frac{\pi}{2}, k\right) }.
\ee
The notation $F(\phi, k)$ is the most common one
in the literature \cite{ByrdF71,GradsRGTJ115}, but one may encounter as well
$F(\phi|m)$ for $F(\phi, k)$ with $m=k^2$ \cite{AbramS72}.
The parameter $k$ is called the \defin{modulus}\index{modulus!of an elliptic integral} of
the elliptic integral. From its expression \eqref{e:gis:def_k_modulus}, we
see that $k$ is a function of $b$. It is plotted in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:elliptic_mod}.
Given the ordering (\ref{e:gis:order_u_zeros}) and the limits (\ref{e:gis:lim_b_inf_u_zeros}),
we deduce from expression (\ref{e:gis:def_k_modulus}) that
\be
    0 < k < 1,
\ee
with
\be \label{e:gis:k_limits_b_gt_bc}
    \lim_{b\to b_{\rm c}^+} k = 1 \qquad\mbox{and}\qquad
    \lim_{b\to +\infty} k = 0 .
\ee
Given the range $(0, u_{\rm p})$ of $u$, we deduce from expression~(\ref{e:gis:phi_u_b})
that
\be
    0 <  \arcsin \sqrt{\frac{u_{\rm n}}{u_{\rm n} - u_{\rm p}}}
     < \phi_b(u) \leq \frac{\pi}{2} ,
\ee
with $\phi_b(u_{\rm p}) = \pi/2$.

for selected values of $b > b_{\rm c}$. For each value of $b$, the range of
$u$ is $(0, u_{\rm p}]$, with the inverse periastron radius $u_{\rm p} = u_{\rm p}(b)$
given by Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:u_per_b}).

\end{figure}

The function $\Phi_b(u)$ is plotted in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:Phib_b_gt_bc} for
various values of $b$. Note that, by construction [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:def_Phib_b_gt_bc})],
$\Phi_b(u) \geq 0$ and $\Phi_b(u) = 0 \iff u = u_{\rm p}$. Note also that the closer
$b$ is from $b_{\rm c} \simeq 5.1961452$, the larger the amplitude of $\Phi_b(u)$. This
point will be discussed further in Secs.~\ref{s:gis:deflect_winding}
and \ref{s:gis:asymp}.

\begin{remark}
One can express $\Phi_b(u)$ in terms of a single elliptic integral
thanks to the following property of incomplete elliptic
integrals of the first kind\footnote{See e.g. Eq.~(117.01) of
Ref.~\cite{ByrdF71} with $k' = \sqrt{1-k^2}$
or Eq.~(17.4.13) of Ref.~\cite{AbramS72} with $\sin\alpha = k$.}:
\be \label{e:gis:add_elliptic_int}
   \tan\psi \tan\phi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - k^2}}\ \Longrightarrow \
   F(\psi, k) = K(k) - F(\phi, k) .
\ee
Then by setting
\be \label{e:gis:psi_u_b}
  \psi_b(u) := \arcsin\left( \frac{1}{k} \sqrt{\frac{u_{\rm p} - u}{u_{\rm a} - u}}\right) ,
\ee
we can rewrite Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:Phib_elliptic_int}) as
\be \label{e:gis:Phib_elliptic_int_psi}
     \Phi_b(u) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{u_{\rm a} - u_{\rm n}}}
    \, F\left( \psi_b(u) ,\; k\right)  .
\ee
We prefer however the form (\ref{e:gis:Phib_elliptic_int}) of $\Phi_b(u)$
because (i) expression (\ref{e:gis:phi_u_b}) for $\phi_b(u)$ is simpler than
expression (\ref{e:gis:psi_u_b}) for $\psi_b(u)$ and (ii) the form (\ref{e:gis:Phib_elliptic_int}) is better adapted to the study of the limit
$b\to b_{\rm c}$, to be discussed in Sec.~\ref{s:gis:asympt_b_gt_bc}.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark} \label{r:gis:Jacobi_elliptic_sine}
The trajectory of a null geodesic in the plane $\th=\pi/2$ as given by
Eqs.~(\ref{e:gis:ph_Phi_b_u}) and (\ref{e:gis:Phib_elliptic_int})
is of the form $\ph = \ph(r)$
on each of the two arcs with respect to the periastron. One can invert
this relation to express the trajectory in the polar form $r = r(\ph)$. This
is performed thanks to the inverse of the incomplete elliptic integral $F(\phi,k)$,
which is the \defin{Jacobi elliptic sine}\index{Jacobi!elliptic sine}\index{elliptic!sine}
$\operatorname{sn}(x,k)$, defined by $\sin\phi = \operatorname{sn}(F(\phi,k), k)$. We deduce then
from Eqs.~(\ref{e:gis:psi_u_b})-(\ref{e:gis:Phib_elliptic_int_psi}) that
\be
    \frac{u_{\rm p} - u}{u_{\rm a} - u} = k^2 \operatorname{sn}\left(
    \frac{\sqrt{u_{\rm a} - u_{\rm n}}}{\sqrt{2}} \Phi_b(u),\; k \right) .
\ee

\subsection{Null geodesics with $b > b_{\rm c}$ and $r< 3m$} \label{s:gis:geod_b_gt_bc_in}

Let us consider now null geodesics still with $b  > b_{\rm c}$ but located
below the photon sphere, i.e. geodesics similar to that labelled 4 in
Figs.~\ref{f:gis:eff_pot_null} and \ref{f:gis:null_geod}. Each of these
geodesics has an apoastron, at $u = u_{\rm a}$, where
$u_{\rm a}$ is the function of $b$ given
by Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:u_apo_b}). In other words,  i.e. one has
$u \geq u_{\rm a}$ along the geodesic.

The treatment is similar to that of Sec.~\ref{s:gis:geod_b_gt_bc_out}, but
with $u_{\rm a}$ playing the role of $u_{\rm p}$.

To be detailed later...


\subsection{Null geodesics with $b < b_{\rm c}$}

A null geodesic $\Li$ with an impact parameter $b < b_{\rm c}$ has neither
a periastron nor an apoastron, since $P_b$ has no zero in the physical range
$(0, +\infty)$ of $u$ in that
case (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:gis:cubic_poly} and Fig.~\ref{f:gis:polynomial_b_u}).
The only real zero of $P_b$ is $u_{\rm n}<0$, which is the function of $b$
given by Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:u_n_b_lt_bc}).
Examples of such geodesics are those labelled 2 and 3
in Figs.~\ref{f:gis:eff_pot_null} and \ref{f:gis:null_geod}.
Having no periastron or apoastron implies that $r$, and hence $u$, is a
monotonic function along $\Li$.
We shall then distinguish two cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Li$ is \defin{ingoing}\index{ingoing!null geodesic}: $r$ decreases all along $\Li$, from $+\infty$ to $0$ as $\tlamb$
varies from $-\infty$ to some value $\tlamb_0$ where $\Li$ hits the curvature
singularity at $r=0$:
\be
    \lim_{\tlamb\to -\infty} r = + \infty
    \ \mbox{and}\
    \lim_{\tlamb\to \tlamb_0} r = 0
    \quad \iff\quad
    \lim_{\tlamb\to -\infty} u = 0
    \ \mbox{and}\
    \lim_{\tlamb\to \tlamb_0} u = +\infty.
\ee
\item $\Li$ is \defin{outgoing}\index{outgoing!null geodesic}: $r$ increases all along $\Li$; as shown in Sec.~\ref{s:ges:eq_to_be_solved}, this cannot happen in the region $r<2m$ (the black
hole interior). Hence, we must have $r$ varying from $2m$ to $+\infty$,
with $\tlamb$ ranging from some finite value, $\tlamb_1$ say, to $+\infty$:
\be
    \lim_{\tlamb\to \tlamb_1} r = 2m
    \ \mbox{and}\
    \lim_{\tlamb\to +\infty} r = +\infty
    \quad \iff\quad
    \lim_{\tlamb\to \tlamb_1} u = \frac{1}{2}
    \ \mbox{and}\
    \lim_{\tlamb\to +\infty} u = 0.
\ee
\end{itemize}
That the range of $\tlamb$ for outgoing geodesics is $(\lambda_1, +\infty)$
and not the whole real line can be understood by considering the limit
$b\to 0$. We are then in the case of radial null geodesics, for which it has
been proved that $r$ is an affine parameter (cf. Secs.~\ref{s:sch:rad_null_geod}
and \ref{s:gis:radial}).
Since this particular affine parameter obviously takes a finite value at $r=2m$,
any other affine parameter must take a finite value as well.
Actually, we shall see in Chap.~\ref{s:max} (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:sch:max_extens_constr})
that this $r=2m$ limit in the
past of outgoing null geodesics does not correspond to the black hole horizon
but to the event horizon of a white hole, which is a located in a part of
the spacetime that is not covered by the Schwarzschild-Droste coordinates
considered here.

\caption[]{\label{f:gis:u0_us_b} \footnotesize

}
\end{figure}


Since $P_b(u_{\rm n}) = 0$, we have $m^2/b^2 = - 2 u_{\rm n}^3 + u_{\rm n}^2$,
so that we may write
\[
    P_b(u) = 2 (u^3 - u_{\rm n}^3) - (u^2 - u_{\rm n}^2)
        = (u - u_{\rm n}) \left[ 2(u^2 + u u_{\rm n} + u_{\rm n}^2)
            - (u + u_{\rm n}) \right] .
\]
After a slight rearrangement of the term in square brackets, we arrive at
\be \label{e:gis:Pb_factor_b_lt_bc}
    P_b(u) = 2 (u - u_{\rm n}) \left[
        (u - u_0)^2 + (u_* - u_{\rm n})^2 - (u_0 - u_{\rm n})^2 \right] ,
\ee
with
\be \label{e:gis:def_u0_us}
   \encadre{ u_0 := \frac{1}{4} - \frac{u_{\rm n}}{2} } \qquad\mbox{and}\qquad
   \encadre{ u_* := \sqrt{u_{\rm n}(3 u_{\rm n} - 1)} + u_{\rm n} }.
\ee
Note that $u_0$ and $u_*$ are functions
of $b$, via the expression (\ref{e:gis:u_n_b_lt_bc}) of $u_{\rm n}$.
They are plotted in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:u0_us_b}. It is clear from this figure
that $u_* > u_0$; consequently the term inside the square brackets in
Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:Pb_factor_b_lt_bc}) is always positive, in agreement with
$u_{\rm n}$ being the only real
zero of $P_b$ for $b < b_{\rm c}$.
Furthermore, according to the limits (\ref{e:gis:range_un_b_lt_bc}), we have
\be \label{e:gis:lim_us}
    \lim_{b\to 0} u_* = +\infty \qquad\mbox{and}\qquad
    \lim_{b\to b_{\rm c}^-} u_* = \frac{1}{3} .
\ee

The general solution of the differential equation
(\ref{e:ges:dphi_du_null}) can be written as
\be \label{e:gis:ph_phs_Phib}
   \encadre{ \ph = \ph_* -  \eps_L \eps_{\rm in} \Phi_b(u) },
\ee
where
\be \label{e:gis:def_Phib_b_lt_bc}
   \encadre{ \Phi_b(u) := \int_u^{u_*} \frac{\D\bar{u}}{\sqrt{P_b(\bar{u})}}
    = \int_u^{u_*} \frac{\D\bar{u}}{\sqrt{2 \bar{u}^3 - \bar{u}^2 + (m/b)^2}} }
     \quad (b<b_{\rm c})
\ee
and $\ph_*$ is the value of $\ph$ at $u=u_*$. Since
\[
    \lim_{b\to b_{\rm c}^-} u_* = \frac{1}{3} = \lim_{b\to b_{\rm c}^+} u_{\rm p},
\]
there is a kind of continuity of (\ref{e:gis:def_Phib_b_lt_bc})
with the definition (\ref{e:gis:def_Phib_b_gt_bc}) of $\Phi_b(u)$ for
$b>b_{\rm c}$, despite the fact that $\Phi_b(u)$ is not defined
for $b=b_{\rm c}$ (more precisely, as we shall see later,
$\lim_{b\to b_{\rm c}^-} \Phi_b(u) = + \infty$ for $u<u_*$ and
$\lim_{b\to b_{\rm c}^+} \Phi_b(u) = + \infty$ for $u<u_{\rm p}$).

To evaluate $\Phi_b(u)$, we shall use expression (\ref{e:gis:Pb_factor_b_lt_bc})
for $P_b(u)$:
\[
    \Phi_b(u) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \int_u^{u_*}
    \frac{\D\bar{u}}{\sqrt{ (\bar{u} - u_{\rm n}) \left[
        (\bar{u} - u_0)^2 + (u_* - u_{\rm n})^2 - (u_0 - u_{\rm n})^2  \right]}} .
\]
Performing the change of variable
\be
    t := \frac{u_* - \bar{u}}{u_* + \bar{u} - 2 u_{\rm n}}
    \quad\iff\quad
    \bar{u} = (u_* - u_{\rm n}) \frac{1-t}{1+t} + u_{\rm n}
\ee
yields
\be \label{e:gis:Phib_t_b_lt_bc}
    \Phi_b(u) =  \int_0^{\frac{u_* - u}{u_* + u - 2 u_{\rm n}}}
    \frac{\D t}{\sqrt{1-t^2}\sqrt{ (u_* - u_{\rm n}) (1+t^2) - (u_0 - u_{\rm n}) (1-t^2) }} .
\ee
Given the range $(0, +\infty)$ for $u$, the range of $t$ is
\[
    -1 < t \leq \frac{u_*}{u_* - 2 u_{\rm n}} < 1 .
\]
To proceed, we shall distinguish the cases $u \leq u_*$ and $u> u_*$.
The first case corresponds to $0 \leq t < \frac{u_*}{u_* - 2 u_{\rm n}} < 1$ and we
perform the change of variable $t = \cos\vartheta$ with $\vartheta\in(0, \pi/2)$ in the integral
(\ref{e:gis:Phib_t_b_lt_bc}), yielding
\[
    \Phi_b(u) =  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2(u_* - u_{\rm n})}} \int_{\phi_b(u))}^{\pi/2}
        \frac{\D\vartheta}{\sqrt{1 - k^2 \sin^2\vartheta}} ,
\]
with
\be \label{e:gis:def_phi_u_b_lt_bc}
   \encadre{ \phi_b(u) := \arccos\left( \frac{|u_* - u|}{u_* + u - 2 u_{\rm n}} \right) }
   \qquad (b < b_{\rm c}).
\ee
and\footnote{To get expression (\ref{e:gis:def_k_b_lt_bc}), we have used
Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:def_u0_us}) to get rid of $u_0$.}
\be \label{e:gis:def_k_b_lt_bc}
   \encadre{ k := \sqrt{\frac{u_* - 5u_{\rm n}/2 + 1/4}{2(u_* - u_{\rm n})}} } \qquad
    (b < b_{\rm c}) .
\ee
The absolute value in the right-hand side of Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:def_phi_u_b_lt_bc}) is not necessary
in the present case since $u \geq u_*$. We keep it because the same
expression will be used below for the case $u > u_*$.
To let appear the incomplete elliptic integral of the first
kind (\ref{e:gis:def_incompl_elliptic_int}), let us rewrite the above
expression as
\[
   \Phi_b(u) =  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2(u_* - u_{\rm n})}}
   \left[ \int_{0}^{\pi/2}
        \frac{\D\vartheta}{\sqrt{1 - k^2 \sin^2\vartheta}}
        - \int_{0}^{\phi_b(u)}
        \frac{\D\vartheta}{\sqrt{1 - k^2 \sin^2\vartheta}} \right] .
\]
In view of respectively (\ref{e:gis:def_K_complete}) and (\ref{e:gis:def_incompl_elliptic_int}),
the first integral is $K(k)$, while the second one is
$F(\phi_b(u), k)$.
We have thus
\be \label{e:gis:Phib_u_lt_us}
    \encadre{ \Phi_b(u) =  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2(u_* - u_{\rm n})}}
    \left[ K(k) - F \left( \phi_b(u),\, k \right) \right]}
    \qquad (u \leq u_*,\ b < b_{\rm c}) .
\ee
As for the case $b>b_{\rm c}$, the modulus $k$ of the elliptic integrals $K$
and $F$ is a function of $b$ only, which
is given by combining Eqs.~(\ref{e:gis:def_k_b_lt_bc}), (\ref{e:gis:def_u0_us})
and (\ref{e:gis:u_n_b_lt_bc}). It is plotted in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:k_b_lt_bc}.
Note that its range is pretty limited:
\be
    \underbrace{\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{3}}}_{\simeq 0.96592}
    < k < 1.
\ee

Let us now turn to the case $u>u_*$. It implies $-1 < t < 0$, so that
we perform the change of variable $t = -\cos\vartheta$ in order to keep
$\vartheta\in(0,\pi/2)$. We obtain then
\[
    \Phi_b(u) =  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2(u_* - u_{\rm n})}} \int_{\pi/2}^{\phi_b(u)}
        \frac{\D\vartheta}{\sqrt{1 - k^2 \sin^2\vartheta}} ,
\]
where $\phi_b(u)$ and $k$ are given by Eqs.~(\ref{e:gis:def_phi_u_b_lt_bc})
and (\ref{e:gis:def_k_b_lt_bc}). We conclude that
\be \label{e:gis:Phib_u_gt_us}
    \encadre{ \Phi_b(u) =  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2(u_* - u_{\rm n})}}
    \left[ F \left( \phi_b(u),\, k \right) - K(k) \right]}

The function $\Phi_b$ evaluated via Eqs.~(\ref{e:gis:Phib_u_lt_us})
and (\ref{e:gis:Phib_u_gt_us}) is plotted in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:Phib_b_lt_bc} for
various values of $b$. Note that, by construction [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:def_Phib_b_lt_bc})],
$\Phi_b(u) = 0 \iff u = u_*$. Note also that, as in the case $b > b_{\rm c}$
(Sec.~\ref{s:gis:geod_b_gt_bc_out}), the closer
$b$ is from $b_{\rm c} \simeq 5.1961452$, the larger the amplitude of $\Phi_b(u)$.


\subsection{Deflection angle and winding number} \label{s:gis:deflect_winding}

Let us consider a null geodesic $\Li$  with $b>b_{\rm c}$ arising from $r\to +\infty$,
i.e. belonging to the family studied in Sec.~\ref{s:gis:geod_b_gt_bc_out}.
$\Li$ reaches some periastron and departs to $r\to +\infty$.
The total change of $\ph$ along the geodesic history is
\be \label{e:gis:def_Delta_ph}
    \Delta \ph = \ph_\infty - \ph_{-\infty} ,
\ee
with $\ph_\infty := \lim_{\tlamb\to +\infty} \ph$ and
$\ph_{-\infty} := \lim_{\tlamb\to -\infty} \ph$.
Given that $\lim_{\tlamb\to \pm\infty} u = 0$,
Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:ph_Phi_b_u}) with respectively
$\eps_{\rm in} = +1$ and $\eps_{\rm in} = -1$ leads to
\be \label{e:gis:ph_inf_ph_p}
    \ph_{-\infty} = \ph_{\rm p} - \eps_L \Phi_b(0) \qquad\mbox{and}\qquad
    \ph_{\infty} = \ph_{\rm p} + \eps_L \Phi_b(0) .
\ee
Hence
\be \label{e:gis:Dph_Phi_b_0}
    \Delta\ph = 2 \eps_L \Phi_b(0) .
\ee

Note that one can have $|\Delta\ph| > 2\pi$; in such a case, the null geodesic
is winding around the black hole before leaving to infinity. We therefore introduce
the \defin{winding number}\index{winding!number!of null geodesic} $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ by
\be \label{e:gis:def_Dph_bar}
    \Delta\ph =: \overline{\Delta\ph} + 2\pi n \quad
    \mbox{with} \quad
    \begin{cases}
    \overline{\Delta\ph} \in [0, 2\pi) &\  \mbox{if}\ L > 0 \\
    \overline{\Delta\ph} \in (-2\pi, 0] &\  \mbox{if}\ L < 0 .
    \end{cases}
\ee
Note that $n\geq 0$ for $L > 0$ and $n\leq 0$ for $L<0$.
We then define the \defin{deflection angle}\index{deflection!angle}
$\Theta$ by
\be \label{e:gis:def_deflection_angle}
    \Theta := \overline{\Delta\ph} - \eps_L \pi .
\ee
Let us recall that $\eps_L = \pm 1$ is the sign of the
conserved angular momentum $L$ [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:def_epsilon_L})].
The $-\eps_L \pi$ term in the above equation is chosen so
that $\Theta = 0$ in flat spacetime (no deflection of light).
By construction, the range of $\Theta$ is
\be
    -\pi \leq \Theta \leq \pi .
\ee

The above concepts are illustrated in Figs.~\ref{f:gis:null_b1}-\ref{f:gis:null_b2},
which show the trajectories
of null geodesics arising from infinity along the
direction $\ph=0$ (i.e. having $\ph_{-\infty}=0$), for various values of the
impact parameter $b$ decaying from $b=12 m$ to $b_{\rm c}$.
They have been computed by means of the geodesic integrator
of \textsf{SageMath} (cf. Appendix~\ref{s:sam}), instead of making use
of the elliptic-integral expression (\ref{e:gis:Phib_elliptic_int}).
All these geodesics have $L>0$ and hence $\eps_L = +1$.
For $b=12 m$ (upper left panel of Fig.~\ref{f:gis:null_b1}),
the geodesic suffers only some moderate bending: the deflection angle is
$\Theta\simeq \pi/6$ and the winding number is $n=0$.
We recover here the standard
\defin{deflection of light}\index{deflection!of light} by massive bodies in
general relativity.
For $b=8 m$ and $6 m$, the bending is more pronounced,
exceeding $\Theta = \pi/2$ for $b=6 m$, still with $n=0$. For $b=5.355\, m$ (lower right panel of Fig.~\ref{f:gis:null_b1}), the deflection angle is $\Theta\simeq\pi$, i.e. the photon goes back in the direction
from which it was coming.

When the impact parameter becomes even closer to the critical value
$b_{\rm c}\simeq 5.196152\, m$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:b_crit})],
the null geodesic starts to wind around the black hole before escaping
to infinity (Fig.~\ref{f:gis:null_b2}).
For $b=5.230\, m$ (upper left panel of Fig.~\ref{f:gis:null_b2}), the winding
number is
$n=1$ and the deflection angle is $\Theta\simeq -\pi/2$.
For $b=5.2025\, m$ (upper right panel of Fig.~\ref{f:gis:null_b2}), one has
$n=1$ and $\Theta=0$. For $b=5.19643\, m$ (lower left panel
of Fig.~\ref{f:gis:null_b2}), one has
$n=1$ and $\Theta\simeq \pi$ and for $b=5.196155\, m$ (lower right panel of Fig.~\ref{f:gis:null_b2}), one has $n=2$ and
$\Theta\simeq \pi/2$.
Note that the winding is taking place
almost at the photon circular orbit ($r=3m$). That after a few turns the null geodesic
departs to infinity corroborates the fact that the photon orbit is unstable
(cf. Sec.~\ref{s:gis:null_eff_pot}).

We can understand the winding phenomenon
around the photon circular orbit for $b$ close to $b_{\rm c}$
without investigating the properties of elliptic integrals.
Indeed, by combining Eqs.~(\ref{e:gis:Dph_Phi_b_0}) and (\ref{e:gis:Phi_b_int_Pb_zeros}),
we get
\be \label{e:ges:Dph_u_per_apo}
    \Delta\ph = \eps_L \sqrt{2} \int_0^{u_{\rm p}}
    \frac{\D u}{\sqrt{(u_{\rm p} - u )(u_{\rm a} - u)(u - u_{\rm n})}} .
\ee
Given the ordering (\ref{e:gis:order_u_zeros}), each of the
three factors under the square root is positive on the integration range
$(0,u_{\rm p})$. For $b\not=b_{\rm c}$, one has $u_{\rm a}\not=u_{\rm p}$
(cf. Fig.~\ref{f:gis:u_per_apo_neg})
and
the only diverging term in the integrand of (\ref{e:ges:Dph_u_per_apo})
is $1/\sqrt{u_{\rm p} - u}$, which
diverges at the integral boundary $u=u_{\rm p}$. However, the integral
\[
    \int_0^{u_{\rm p}}
    \frac{\D u}{\sqrt{u_{\rm p} - u}}
\]
is finite, being equal to $2\sqrt{u_{\rm p}}$, so that $\Delta\ph$ remains
finite. When $b\to b_{\rm c}$,
$u_{\rm a} \to u_{\rm p}$ and the integral (\ref{e:ges:Dph_u_per_apo})
has a behavior similar to
\[
     \int_0^{u_{\rm p}}
    \frac{\D u}{\sqrt{(u_{\rm p} - u)^2}} = \int_0^{u_{\rm p}}
    \frac{\D u}{u_{\rm p} - u} .
\]
Since the latter is a diverging integral, we conclude that
\be \label{e:ges:Dph_infinite}
    \encadre{ \Delta\ph\to \pm\infty\quad\mbox{when}\quad b\to b_{\rm c} }.
\ee
We recover the behavior observed for $b=b_{\rm c}$ in
Sec.~\ref{s:gis:extern_crit_geod}: for
an external critical null geodesic,
$\Delta\ph$ is infinite, the geodesic spiralling indefinitely around the
photon orbit (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:gis:null_b_crit_from_inf_L_pos}).
We shall refine (\ref{e:ges:Dph_infinite}) in Sec.~\ref{s:gis:asympt_b_gt_bc}
[Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:Dph_ln_b_bc})].

\section{Asymptotic direction from some emission point} \label{s:gis:asymp}

To discuss images in Sec.~\ref{s:gis:images},
we shall need the change in $\ph$ between some
arbitrary point on a null geodesic (the ``emission'' point)
and a point far away from the black hole (the ``reception'' point).
The total change $\Delta\ph$ along all the geodesic history
considered in Sec.~\ref{s:gis:deflect_winding} is then a special case: that for which the emission point is
infinitely far from the black hole.

\subsection{Asymptotic direction for $b > b_{\rm c}$} \label{s:gis:asympt_b_gt_bc}

Let us consider a null geodesic $\Li$ with $b>b_{\rm c}$ and an event
of (finite) affine parameter $\tlamb = \tlamb_{\rm em}$ on $\Li$, which we
shall call the \emph{emission point}. We are interested in null geodesics
which reach the asymptotic flat region $r\to+\infty$ for $\tlamb\to+\infty$.
This implies that the emission point is located outside the photon sphere, i.e.
obeys
\be \label{e:gis:rem_gt_3m}
    r_{\rm em} := r(\tlamb_{\rm em}) > 3 m.
\ee
Indeed, we have seen in
Sec.~\ref{s:gis:geod_b_gt_bc_in} that null geodesics with $b > b_{\rm c}$
and emitted under the photon sphere never cross the later (this is also
obvious from the effective potential profile, as plotted in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:eff_pot_null},
cf. trajectory no.~4).
Our aim is to relate the value $\ph_\infty$ of $\ph$ for $\tlamb\to +\infty$
(the asymptotic direction) to its value $\ph_{\rm em}$ at $\tlamb = \tlamb_{\rm em}$.

If the emission point is past $\Li$'s periastron, i.e. if
$\tlamb_{\rm em} > \tlamb_{\rm p}$, $\ph_{\rm em}$ is related to $\ph_{\rm p}$
by Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:ph_Phi_b_u}) with $\eps_{\rm in} = -1$:
\be
    \ph_{\rm em} = \ph_{\rm p} + \eps_L \Phi_b(u_{\rm em}) ,
\ee
where $u_{\rm em}:=m/r_{\rm em}$.
On the other side, the asymptotic value $\ph_\infty$ is related to $\ph_{\rm p}$
by Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:ph_inf_ph_p}). By combining these two relations
to eliminate $\ph_{\rm p}$, we get
\be
    \ph_\infty = \ph_{\rm em} + \eps_L \left[ \Phi_b(0) - \Phi_b(u_{\rm em}) \right] .
\ee
Substituting expression (\ref{e:gis:Phib_elliptic_int}) for $\Phi_b$ yields
\be \label{e:gis:ph_inf_em_past_per}
   \encadre{ \ph_\infty = \ph_{\rm em} + \eps_L \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{u_{\rm a} - u_{\rm n}}}
    \left[ F\left(\phi_b(u_{\rm em}), k\right)
           - F\left(\phi_b(0), k \right) \right] } \qquad
           {(b > b_{\rm c})\atop(\tlamb_{\rm em} > \tlamb_{\rm p})} ,
\ee
where, according to Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:phi_u_b}),
\be \label{e:gis:phi_em_0_b_gt_bc}
   \phi_b(u_{\rm em}) = \arcsin\sqrt{\frac{u_{\rm em} - u_{\rm n}}{u_{\rm p} - u_{\rm n}}}
   \qquad\mbox{and}\qquad
   \phi_b(0) = \arcsin \sqrt{\frac{|u_{\rm n}|}{u_{\rm p} - u_{\rm n}}} .
\ee

If the emission point is located prior
to the periastron, i.e. if $\tlamb_{\rm em} < \tlamb_{\rm p}$,
$\ph_{\rm em}$ is related to $\ph_{\rm p}$
by Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:ph_Phi_b_u}) with $\eps_{\rm in} = +1$:
\be
    \ph_{\rm em} = \ph_{\rm p} - \eps_L \Phi_b(u_{\rm em})
\ee
and we get, by combining with Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:ph_inf_ph_p}),
\be
    \ph_\infty = \ph_{\rm em} + \eps_L \left[ \Phi_b(0) + \Phi_b(u_{\rm em}) \right] .
\ee
Equation~(\ref{e:gis:Phib_elliptic_int}) then yields
\be \label{e:gis:ph_inf_em_prior_per}
   \encadre{ \ph_\infty = \ph_{\rm em} + \eps_L \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{u_{\rm a} - u_{\rm n}}}
    \left[ 2 K(k) - F\left(\phi_b(u_{\rm em}), k\right)
           - F\left(\phi_b(0), k \right) \right] } \qquad
           {(b > b_{\rm c})\atop (\tlamb_{\rm em} < \tlamb_{\rm p})} .
\ee
$\ph_\infty - \ph_{\rm em}$ is plotted as a function of $b$ in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:phi_inf_em_b}
for various values of $r_{\rm em} = m / u_{\rm em}$, with the dashed curves
corresponding to the case $\tlamb_{\rm em} > \tlamb_{\rm p}$.
We notice that for $b \gg m$ (cf. the red curve near $b = 12 m$), one has
either $\ph_\infty - \ph_{\rm em} \simeq 0$ (dashed red curve: $\tlamb_{\rm em} > \tlamb_{\rm p}$)
or $\ph_\infty - \ph_{\rm em} \simeq \pi$ (solid red curve: $\tlamb_{\rm em} < \tlamb_{\rm p}$):
null geodesics with large impact parameters suffer almost no deflection,
as expected. Another striking feature of Fig.~\ref{f:gis:phi_inf_em_b}
is the divergence of $\ph_\infty - \ph_{\rm em}$ when $b$ tends to $b_{\rm c}$.
Let us examine this in details.

The dashed curves correspond to trajectories with $b > b_{\rm c}$ that do not pass
through the periastron. For each value of $r_{\rm em} > 3m$, the maximum of
$b$ is given by $r_{\rm p}(b) = r_{\rm em}$, i.e. by
$b^2 = r_{\rm em}^3/(r_{\rm em} - 2 m)$ [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:r_per_null})
and Fig.~\ref{f:gis:null_per_apo}].

\subsubsection{Limit $b \to b_{\rm c}^+$}

From Eqs.~(\ref{e:gis:zeros_Pbu}), we have the following
limits:
\be \label{e:gis:lim_u_n_p_a}
\lim_{b\to b_{\rm c}^+} u_{\rm n} = -\frac{1}{6} \qquad\mbox{and}\qquad
\lim_{b\to b_{\rm c}^+} u_{\rm p} = \lim_{b\to b_{\rm c}^+} u_{\rm a} = \frac{1}{3} .
\ee
It follows then from expressions~(\ref{e:gis:phi_em_0_b_gt_bc}) that
\be \label{e:gis:lim_phi_em_0_b_gt_bc}
    \lim_{b\to b_{\rm c}^+} \phi_b(u_{\rm em}) = \arcsin \sqrt{2 u_{\rm em} + \frac{1}{3}}
    \qquad\mbox{and}\qquad
   \lim_{b\to b_{\rm c}^+} \phi_b(0) = \arcsin \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) .
\ee
Besides, $\lim_{b\to b_{\rm c}^+} k = 1$ [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:k_limits_b_gt_bc})]
and, for any $\phi\in{}[0,\pi/2)$, the definition
(\ref{e:gis:def_incompl_elliptic_int}) of $F$ leads to
\be \label{e:gis:F_k_one}
    F(\phi, 1) = \int_0^\phi \frac{\D\vartheta}{\sqrt{1 - \sin^2\vartheta}}
        = \int_0^\phi \frac{\D\vartheta}{\cos\vartheta}
        = \ln\left( \frac{1 + \sin\phi}{\cos\phi} \right) .
\ee
The limits (\ref{e:gis:lim_phi_em_0_b_gt_bc}) result then
in
\be \label{e:gis:lim_F_b_gt_bc}
     \lim_{b\to b_{\rm c}^+} F\left(\phi_b(u_{\rm em}), k\right) =
     \ln \left(
     \frac{\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{6 u_{\rm em} + 1 }}{\sqrt{2(1 - 3 u_{\rm em})}} \right)
     \quad\mbox{and}\quad
     \lim_{b\to b_{\rm c}^+} F\left(\phi_b(0), k\right) =
     \ln \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) .
\ee
For $\tlamb_{\rm em} > \tlamb_{\rm p}$, inserting these formulas into
(\ref{e:gis:ph_inf_em_past_per}) leads to
\be \label{e:gis:ph_inf_ph_em_lim_post_per}
    \encadre{ \ph_\infty \underset{b\to b_{\rm c}^+}{\sim} \ph_{\rm em}
    + \eps_L \ln \left(
    \frac{2 + 3 u_{\rm em} + \sqrt{3(6 u_{\rm em} + 1)}}{(2+\sqrt{3})(1 - 3 u_{\rm em})}
    \right) }
    \qquad (\tlamb_{\rm em} > \tlamb_{\rm p}) .
\ee
Note that the constraint (\ref{e:gis:rem_gt_3m}) is equivalent to
$1 - 3 u_{\rm em} > 0$, so that the above formula is well posed.

For the case $\tlamb_{\rm em} < \tlamb_{\rm p}$, $\ph_\infty$ is given
by Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:ph_inf_em_prior_per}) and
we need to determine the behavior of $K(k)$ to conclude.
Actually, when $k\to 1$, $K(k)$ is diverging with the following behavior\footnote{See e.g. Eq.~(112.1) of Ref.~\cite{ByrdF71} with
$k' = \sqrt{1-k^2}$ or Eq.~(17.3.26) of
Ref.~\cite{AbramS72} with $m = k^2$ and $m_1 = 1 - k^2$.}:
\be \label{e:gis:limk1_K}
    \lim_{k\to 1} \left[ K(k) - \ln\left(\frac{4}{\sqrt{1-k^2}}\right) \right] = 0 .
\ee
To relate $\sqrt{1 - k^2}$ to $b - b_{\rm c}$, let us introduce the small parameter
$\veps >0$ such that
\be \label{e:ges:u_per_eps}
    u_{\rm p} =: \frac{1}{3} - \veps.
\ee
The relation $P_b(u_{\rm p}) = 0$, once expanded to second
order in $\veps^2$, leads to the following relation between $b - b_{\rm c}$
and $\veps$:
\be \label{e:ges:b_bc_eps}
    \frac{b-b_{\rm c}}{m} = \frac{81\sqrt{3}}{2} \veps^2 + O(\veps^3).
\ee
Besides, from the expressions (\ref{e:gis:una_up}) of $u_{\rm n}$ and
$u_{\rm a}$ in terms of $u_{\rm p}$, we get, still to the second order in $\veps$,
\[
    u_{\rm n} = - \frac{1}{6} + 2 \veps^2 + O(\veps^3)
    \qquad\mbox{and}\qquad
    u_{\rm a} = \frac{1}{3} + \veps - 2 \veps^2
     + O(\veps^3) .
\]
Substituting these values in the expression (\ref{e:gis:def_k_modulus})
of the modulus $k$ and expanding to the first order in $\veps$ leads to
\[
    k = 1 - 2 \veps + O(\veps^2),
\]
from which
\[
    \sqrt{1 - k^2} \underset{\veps\to 0}{\sim} \sqrt{1 - (1 - 4\veps)}
            \underset{\veps\to 0}{\sim}  2 \sqrt{\veps} .
\]
The property (\ref{e:gis:limk1_K}) then leads to
\[
    2 K(k) \underset{\veps\to 0}{\sim} 2 \ln\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{\veps}}\right)
       \underset{\veps\to 0}{\sim} \ln\left(\frac{4}{\veps}\right)  .
\]
Using this result, as well as (\ref{e:gis:lim_F_b_gt_bc}), in
Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:ph_inf_em_prior_per}) yields
\begin{align}
  \ph_\infty & \underset{b\to b_{\rm c}^+}{\sim} \ph_{\rm em}
   + \eps_L \times 2 \left[ \ln\left(\frac{4}{\veps}\right)
   - \ln \left(
     \frac{\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{6 u_{\rm em} + 1 }}{\sqrt{2(1 - 3 u_{\rm em})}} \right)
   - \ln \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \right] \nonumber \\
   & \underset{b\to b_{\rm c}^+}{\sim} \ph_{\rm em}
   + \eps_L \ln\left(\frac{16}{\veps^2}
   \frac{2(1 - 3 u_{\rm em})}{(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{6 u_{\rm em} + 1 })^2}
   \frac{2}{(\sqrt{3} + 1)^2} \right) . \nonumber
\end{align}
Note that we have used the limits (\ref{e:gis:lim_u_n_p_a})
to evaluate the prefactor in Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:ph_inf_em_prior_per})
as $\sqrt{2/(u_{\rm a} - u_{\rm n})} \sim \sqrt{2/(1/3 - (-1/6))} = 2$.
Expressing $\veps^2$ in terms of $b - b_{\rm c}$ via Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:b_bc_eps})
leads to the final formula:
\be \label{e:gis:ph_inf_ph_em_lim_b_gt_bc}
   \encadre{  \ph_\infty  \underset{b\to b_{\rm c}^+}{\sim} \ph_{\rm em}
   + \eps_L \ln \left(
   \frac{648(2\sqrt{3} - 3) (1 - 3 u_{\rm em})}{2 + 3 u_{\rm em}
   + \sqrt{3(1 + 6 u_{\rm em})}} \times \frac{m}{b - b_{\rm c}} \right)
   } \qquad (\tlamb_{\rm em} < \tlamb_{\rm p}) .
\ee
The prefactor of $m/(b - b_{\rm c})$ in the logarithm is
plotted as a function of $r_{\rm em} = m/u_{\rm em}$ in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:A_rem} below.

The value of the total change $\Delta\ph$ along the complete geodesic history
[cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:def_Delta_ph})]
is obtained by taking the limit $u_{\rm em}\to 0$ (i.e. $r_{\rm em} \to +\infty$)
in this formula. We get
\be \label{e:gis:Dph_ln_b_bc}
   \encadre{ \Delta\ph \underset{b\to b_{\rm c}^+}{\sim}
    \eps_L \ln\left( \frac{648(7\sqrt{3} - 12) m}{b-b_{\rm c}} \right) } .
\ee
We recover the result (\ref{e:ges:Dph_infinite}): $\Delta\ph$ is diverging
when $b\to b_{\rm c}^+$. Moreover, Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:Dph_ln_b_bc}) specifies
this divergence as logarithmic in $b - b_{\rm c}$. More generally,
Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:ph_inf_ph_em_lim_b_gt_bc}) shows that $\ph_\infty - \ph_{\rm em}$
diverges logarithmically in $b - b_{\rm c}$ when $b\to b_{\rm c}^+$, whatever the position
of the emission point.

Let us express $\Delta\ph$ is terms of the deflection angle $\Theta$ and
the winding number $n$ through Eqs.~(\ref{e:gis:def_Dph_bar}) and
(\ref{e:gis:def_deflection_angle}):
\be
    \Delta\ph = \Theta - \eps_L \pi + 2\pi n .
\ee
We can then deduce from (\ref{e:gis:Dph_ln_b_bc}) that
\be \label{e:ges:b_bc_exp_Theta}
   \encadre{ b - b_{\rm c} \underset{b\to b_{\rm c}^+}{\sim}
    \underbrace{648(7\sqrt{3} - 12)\mathrm{e}^{-\pi}}_{\simeq 3.482284} m \, \mathrm{e}^{-\eps_L \Theta - 2\pi |n|}  }.
\ee
In the above writing, we have used the fact that the sign of $n$ is the same
as that of $L$, so that $\eps_L n = |n|$.
\begin{remark}
A check of Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:Dph_ln_b_bc}) is obtained by comparing it with
Eq.~(268) in Chap.~3 of Ref.~\cite{Chand83}, where $\delta D = b-b_{\rm c}$ and
$\Theta$ is the same as ours, or with Eq.~(7.4.54) of Ref.~\cite{FroloZ11},
where $\Delta\ell = (b - b_{\rm c})/(2 m)$.
\end{remark}

\begin{hist} \label{h:gis:Darwin_formula}
Equation~(\ref{e:ges:b_bc_exp_Theta}) has been first derived by
Charles Galton Darwin\index[pers]{Darwin, C.G.} -- the grandson of the famous naturalist Charles Robert Darwin -- in 1959 \cite{Darwi59} (cf. Eqs.~(31) and (32) of Ref.~\cite{Darwi59}, where $\mu = \Theta$).
\end{hist}


\subsection{Asymptotic direction for $b < b_{\rm c}$}

When the impact parameter $b$ is lower than the critical value,
the null geodesic $\Li$ has no periastrion and $\ph_{\rm em}$ and $\ph_\infty$
are given by Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:ph_phs_Phib}) with $\eps_{\rm in} = -1$
(outgoing motion):
\be
    \ph_{\rm em} = \ph_* +  \eps_L \Phi_b(u_{\rm em})
    \qquad\mbox{and}\qquad
    \ph_\infty = \ph_* +  \eps_L \Phi_b(0) .
\ee
We have then
\be \label{e:gis:ph_inf_b_lt_bc_prov}
    \ph_\infty = \ph_{\rm em} + \eps_L \left[  \Phi_b(0) - \Phi_b(u_{\rm em}) \right] .
\ee
$\Phi_b(0)$ is given by Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:Phib_u_lt_us}):
\be \label{e:gis:Phib_0_b_lt_bc}
   \Phi_b(0) =  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2(u_* - u_{\rm n})}}
    \left[ K(k) - F \left( \phi_b(0),\, k \right) \right] .
\ee
If $u_{\rm em} < u_*$, $\Phi_b(u_{\rm em})$ is given by Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:Phib_u_lt_us})
as well, so that Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:ph_inf_b_lt_bc_prov}) becomes
\be \label{e:gis:ph_inf_u_em_lt_us}
    \encadre{ \ph_\infty = \ph_{\rm em} + \frac{\eps_L}{\sqrt{2(u_* - u_{\rm n})}}
    \left[ F \left( \phi_b(u_{\rm em}),\, k \right)  - F \left( \phi_b(0),\, k \right) \right]
    } \qquad {(b < b_{\rm c})\atop (u_{\rm em} < u_*)} ,
\ee
with $\phi_b(u_{\rm em})$ and $\phi_b(0)$ given by Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:def_phi_u_b_lt_bc}):
\be \label{e:gis:phi_em_0_b_lt_bc}
   \phi_b(u_{\rm em}) = \arccos\left( \frac{|u_* - u_{\rm em}|}{u_* + u_{\rm em} - 2 u_{\rm n}} \right)
   \qquad\mbox{and}\qquad
   \phi_b(0) = \arccos\left( \frac{u_*}{u_* - 2 u_{\rm n}} \right) .
\ee

If $u_{\rm em} > u_*$, then $\Phi_b(u_{\rm em})$ is given by Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:Phib_u_gt_us}).
Combining with Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:Phib_0_b_lt_bc}), we can then write
Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:ph_inf_b_lt_bc_prov}) as
\be \label{e:gis:ph_inf_u_em_gt_us}
    \encadre{ \ph_\infty = \ph_{\rm em} + \frac{\eps_L}{\sqrt{2(u_* - u_{\rm n})}}
    \left[ 2K(k) - F \left( \phi_b(u_{\rm em}),\, k \right)  - F \left( \phi_b(0),\, k \right) \right]
    } \qquad {(b < b_{\rm c})\atop (u_{\rm em} > u_*)} ,
\ee
where $\phi_b(u_{\rm em})$ is still given by Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:phi_em_0_b_lt_bc}).
$\ph_\infty - \ph_{\rm em}$ is plotted as a function of $b$ in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:phi_inf_em_b}
for various values of $r_{\rm em} = m / u_{\rm em}$. For $r_{\rm em} \gg m$
(cf. the red curve $r_{\rm em} = 100 \, m$ for $b< b_{\rm c}$), we note that
$\ph_\infty - \ph_{\rm em} \simeq 0$, as expected. As for the case $b > b_{\rm c}$,
we also note that $\ph_\infty - \ph_{\rm em}$ is diverging when $b$ tends
to $b_{\rm c}$. Let us quantify this diverging behavior:


\subsubsection{Limit $b \to b_{\rm c}^-$}

When $b \to b_{\rm c}^-$, we have the following limits
[cf. Eqs.~(\ref{e:gis:range_un_b_lt_bc}) and (\ref{e:gis:lim_us})]:
\[
 \lim_{b\to b_{\rm c}^-} u_{\rm n} = - \frac{1}{6}
 \qquad\mbox{and}\qquad
 \lim_{b\to b_{\rm c}^-} u_* = \frac{1}{3} .
\]
Consequently, Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:phi_em_0_b_lt_bc}) yields
\be \label{e:gis:lim_phi_em_0_b_lt_bc}
   \lim_{b\to b_{\rm c}^-} \phi_b(u_{\rm em}) =
    \arccos\left( \frac{|1 - 3 u_{\rm em}|}{2 + 3 u_{\rm em}} \right)
   \quad\mbox{and}\quad
   \lim_{b\to b_{\rm c}^-} \phi_b(0) = \arccos\left( \frac{1}{2} \right) = \frac{\pi}{3}.
\ee
Moreover, from expression (\ref{e:gis:def_k_b_lt_bc}) for $k$ and the above
limits for $u_*$ and $u_{\rm n}$, we have (see also Fig.~\ref{f:gis:k_b_lt_bc})
\[
    \lim_{b\to b_{\rm c}^-} k = 1 .
\]
Given the values (\ref{e:gis:lim_phi_em_0_b_lt_bc}) and expression
(\ref{e:gis:F_k_one}) for the elliptic integral $F$ when $k=1$, we get
\begin{subequations}
\label{e:gis:lim_F_em_0_b_lt_bc}
\begin{align}
    & \lim_{b\to b_{\rm c}^-} F \left( \phi_b(u_{\rm em}),\, k \right)  =
    \ln \left(
      \frac{2 + 3 u_{\rm em} + \sqrt{3(1+6 u_{\rm em})}}{|1 - 3 u_{\rm em}|}
      \right) \\
    & \lim_{b\to b_{\rm c}^-} F \left( \phi_b(0),\, k \right)  = \ln(2 + \sqrt{3}) .
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
When $u_{\rm em} < u_*$, inserting these formulas into
Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:ph_inf_u_em_lt_us}) leads to
\be \label{e:gis:ph_inf_lim_b_lt_bc_u_lt_us}
    \encadre{ \ph_\infty \underset{b\to b_{\rm c}^-}{\sim} \ph_{\rm em}
    + \eps_L \ln \left(
    \frac{2 + 3 u_{\rm em} + \sqrt{3(6 u_{\rm em} + 1)}}{(2+\sqrt{3})(1 - 3 u_{\rm em})}
    \right) }
    \qquad \left(u_{\rm em} < \frac{1}{3} \right) .
\ee
We have written $u_{\rm em} < 1/3$ because $u_*\to 1/3$ when
$b\to b_{\rm c}^-$. For this reason, we also get rid of the absolute value
around $1 - 3  u_{\rm em}$.
Note that the value of $\ph_\infty$ given by Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:ph_inf_lim_b_lt_bc_u_lt_us})
is identical to that given by Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:ph_inf_ph_em_lim_post_per}),
which was obtained for $b\to b_{\rm c}^+$ and an emission point beyond the
periastron. This is not surprising if one invokes the continuity around $b=b_{\rm c}$ of
null geodesics as regards their part beyond the periastron for $b > b_{\rm c}$
and outside $r = 3 m$ for $b < b_{\rm c}$. Indeed, the geodesics with $b \to b_{\rm c}^+$
differ significantly from those with $b \to b_{\rm c}^-$ only on
parts including the periastron. This continuity appears clearly on Fig.~\ref{f:gis:phi_inf_em_b}:
the curves with $b<b_{\rm c}$ and $r_{\rm em} > 3 m$ have a continuous prolongation
with the dashed curves, which are the curves with $b>b_{\rm c}$ without any periastrion
on the path from the emission point to infinity.

For $u_{\rm em} > u_*$, we shall use formula (\ref{e:gis:ph_inf_u_em_gt_us}), with
$K(k)$ having the diverging behavior (\ref{e:gis:limk1_K})
since $\lim_{b\to b_{\rm c}^-} k = 1$. To express $K(k)$ in terms of
$|b - b_{\rm c}|$, let us introduce the small parameter $\veps > 0$ such that
\be \label{e:gis:u_n_eps}
    u_{\rm n} = - \frac{1}{6} - \veps.
\ee
The relation $P_b(u_{\rm n}) = 0$, once expanded to first order in $\veps$,
leads then to the following relation between $b_{\rm c} - b$ and $\veps$:
\be \label{e:gis:bc_b_veps}
    \frac{b_{\rm c} - b}{m} = \frac{81\sqrt{3}}{4} \veps.
\ee
Besides, by expanding formula (\ref{e:gis:def_u0_us}) at first order in $\veps$,
we get
\[
    u_* = \frac{1}{3} + \veps + O(\veps^2) .
\]
Substituting this value, as well as (\ref{e:gis:u_n_eps}), into expression
(\ref{e:gis:def_k_b_lt_bc}) for $k$ yields
\[
    k = 1 - \frac{\veps}{4} + O(\veps^2) ,
\]
so that
\[
    \sqrt{1 - k^2} \underset{\veps\to 0}{\sim} \sqrt{1 - \left(1 - \frac{\veps}{2}\right)}
     \underset{\veps\to 0}{\sim} \sqrt{\frac{\veps}{2}}
\]
The property (\ref{e:gis:limk1_K}) then leads to
\[
    2 K(k) \underset{\veps\to 0}{\sim} 2 \ln\left(\frac{4\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{\veps}}\right)
       \underset{\veps\to 0}{\sim} \ln\left(\frac{32}{\veps}\right)  .
\]
Substituting this expression for $K(k)$, as well as Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:lim_F_em_0_b_lt_bc})
for $F \left( \phi_b(u_{\rm em}),\, k \right)$ and $F \left( \phi_b(0),\, k \right)$,
into Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:ph_inf_u_em_gt_us}) results in
\begin{align}
\ph_\infty & \underset{b\to b_{\rm c}^-}{\sim} \ph_{\rm em}
    + \frac{\eps_L}{\sqrt{2\left(\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{6}\right)}} \left[
  \ln\left(\frac{32}{\veps}\right)
    -  \ln \left(
      \frac{2 + 3 u_{\rm em} + \sqrt{3(1+6 u_{\rm em})}}{3 u_{\rm em} - 1}
      \right)
    - \ln(2 + \sqrt{3}) \right] \nonumber \\
 & \underset{b\to b_{\rm c}^-}{\sim} \ph_{\rm em}
 + \eps_L \ln \left( \frac{32}{\veps}
 \frac{(2 - \sqrt{3})(3 u_{\rm em} - 1)}{2 + 3 u_{\rm em} + \sqrt{3(1 + 6 u_{\rm em})}}
 \right) . \nonumber
\end{align}
Finally, using (\ref{e:gis:bc_b_veps}) to let appear $b_{\rm c} - b$
instead of $\veps$, we get
\be \label{e:gis:ph_inf_lim_b_lt_bc_u_gt_us}
 \encadre{ \ph_\infty  \underset{b\to b_{\rm c}^-}{\sim} \ph_{\rm em}
   + \eps_L \ln \left(
   \frac{648(2\sqrt{3} - 3)(3 u_{\rm em} - 1)}{2 + 3 u_{\rm em} + \sqrt{3(1 + 6 u_{\rm em})}}
   \times\frac{m}{b_{\rm c} - b} \right)
 } \qquad \left(u_{\rm em} > \frac{1}{3} \right) .
\ee
Hence we recover a logarithmic divergence of $\ph_\infty - \ph_{\rm em}$
when $b$ tends to $b_{\rm c}$ by lower values.

\begin{remark} \label{r:gis:prefactor_b_bc}
The prefactor of $m/(b_{\rm c} - b)$ in
formula (\ref{e:gis:ph_inf_lim_b_lt_bc_u_gt_us}) is exactly the
opposite of the prefactor of $m/(b - b_{\rm c})$ in formula (\ref{e:gis:ph_inf_ph_em_lim_b_gt_bc}).
It is plotted as a function of $r_{\rm em} = m/u_{\rm em}$ in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:A_rem} below.
\end{remark}

The upper bound on $u_{\rm em}$ is $1/2$, for this corresponds to a source
just outside the black hole event horizon at $r=2m$. Let us evaluate
$\ph_\infty$ in this limit; setting $u_{\rm em}\to 1/2$ in Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:ph_inf_lim_b_lt_bc_u_gt_us}) results in, after simplification,
\be  \label{e:gis:ph_inf_lim_b_lt_bc_uem_1_2}
   \ph_\infty  \underset{b\to b_{\rm c}^-}{\sim} \ph_{\rm em}
    + \eps_L  \ln\left( \frac{648(26\sqrt{3} - 45) m}{b_{\rm c} - b} \right)
    \qquad \left( u_{\rm em} \to \frac{1}{2} \right) .
\ee

\begin{remark}
As a check, Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:ph_inf_lim_b_lt_bc_uem_1_2}) agrees with
Eq.~(4) in Ref.~\cite{GrallHW19}.
\end{remark}

\section{Images} \label{s:gis:images}

Being the worldlines of photons, null geodesics are the key ingredient
in determining images as seen by some observer of emitting material around
a black hole. Computing such images is of great interest, especially after
the first image of a black hole vicinity obtained by
the Event Horizon Telescope team in 2019 \cite{EHT19a,Cardo19}.
As stated in Sec.~\ref{s:gis:intro}, we shall differ the discussion of
that image to the chapter dealing with rotating black holes
(Sec.~\ref{s:gik:M87_image}).

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{gis_obs_angle.pdf}}
\caption[]{\label{f:gis:obs_angle} \footnotesize
Link between the observation angle $\hat{b}$ and the impact parameter $b$
for an asymptotic observer $\Obs$ located at $r_{\Obs} \gg m$.}
\end{figure}


\subsection{The asymptotic observer} \label{s:gis:asympt_obs}

Let us consider some ``far-away'' static observer, i.e.
an observer $\Obs$ located at $r = r_{\Obs} \gg m$. Without
any loss of generality, we may assume that $\Obs$ is located at $\th=\pi/2$ and $\ph=0$
(cf. Fig.~\ref{f:gis:obs_angle}).
Furthermore, we suppose that $\Obs$ is
equipped with an optical device (telescope\index{telescope}) pointing in the direction from $\Obs$ to the black hole, which
is the $x$-axis in terms of the coordinates $(x,y):=(r\cos\ph,r\sin\ph)$.
Images are formed by null geodesics reaching $\Obs$'s screen with a angle
$\hat{b}$ with respect to the telescope axis (in $\Obs$'s frame) within the
telescope aperture\index{telescope!aperture}. The angle $\hat{b}$ is actually
related to the geodesic impact parameter $b$ by
$\sin\hat{b} = b / r_{\Obs}$ (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:gis:obs_angle}), which,
for large $r_{\Obs}$, can be rewritten as
\be \label{e:gis:hat_b}
    \hat{b} = \frac{b}{r_{\Obs}} .
\ee
A second parameter characterizing any incoming null geodesic is a polar
angle $\alpha\in{[0, 2\pi)}$ so that $(\hat{b},\alpha)$ are spherical
coordinates on $\Obs$'s celestial sphere, the North pole ($\hat{b}=0$) of which
coinciding with the direction to the black hole. The image on $\Obs$'s screen\index{screen}
at the telescope output may be then parameterized by polar coordinates $(\hat{b}, \alpha)$, with $\hat{b}$ representing the distance to the screen's center.
Other projections from the celestial sphere to the planar screen may be considered
but this is rather unimportant here, given the small field of view of the telescope.
In what follows, we shall use directly $b$, instead of $\hat{b}$, as
the radial coordinate in the screen plane. According to Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:hat_b}),
this amounts to drop the constant
scale factor $1/r_{\Obs}$.

Moreover, we shall consider the asymptotic observer limit: $r_{\Obs}\to\infty$.
In that limit, null geodesics that reach $\Obs$ must have
\be \label{e:gis:ph_inf_0_mod_2pi}
\ph_\infty = 0 \mod 2 \pi .
\ee

\begin{figure}

$0.8 m$, while the olive ones have $b$ close to $b_{\rm c}$,
namely $b/m\in\{5.0, 5.2, 5.4\}$. $S$ is a luminous point source
and three of its images for an observer at $y=0$ and $x\to + \infty$ are obtained by
following the drawn null geodesics through $S$.

\subsection{Images of a point source} \label{s:gis:images_point}


\subsubsection{Qualitative analysis from a concrete example}

To understand the formation of images on $\Obs$'s screen, a bunch of null
geodesics with $\ph_\infty=0$ is drawn in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:mult_images}.
$\Obs$ is located in the far right of this figure and
all the drawn geodesics eventually hit $\Obs$'s screen. Let us consider a luminous point source
$S$. From the drawing of Fig.~\ref{f:gis:mult_images},
three null geodesics of the $\ph_\infty=0$ family goes through $S$. They give rise to
three distinct images of $S$ on $\Obs$'s screen, which are represented by the
open circles labelled 1 to 3 in the right part of the figure. These three
geodesics can be distinguished by their deflection angle $\Theta$
and their winding number $n$ (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:gis:deflect_winding}).
The geodesic giving image 1 is the less deflected one: it has $\Theta \simeq - \pi/4$
and $n=0$, while that
of image 2 has $\Theta\simeq 2\pi/3$ and $n=0$.
The geodesic giving image 3 is much more deflected
it makes a full turn around
the black hole before reaching $\Obs$; it's winding number is $n=-1$ and
it has $\Theta\simeq -\pi/6$.
We note that the more deflected the geodesic,
the closer the image with respect to the circle $b = b_{\rm c}$ on $\Obs$'s
screen.

For the sake of clarity, only three images of the source $S$ have been
depicted in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:mult_images}, but we are going to see
that there is actually an infinite
number of them: two per value of $|n|$ (the number of turns around the black hole)
--- one with $L>0$ and one with $L<0$.

\begin{remark}
In Fig.~\ref{f:gis:mult_images}, the source $S$ is rather close to the
black hole but it is worth to stress that
the multiple character of the images of a given
source is not due to the proximity between the source and the black hole.
Multiple images are formed for any source, even very far ones.
For instance, the source can lie \emph{behind} the
observer, i.e. one can have $x_S > x_{\Obs}$. This is clear if we consider
the lower-right panel of Fig.~\ref{f:gis:null_b1} (case $b=5.355\, m$):
a source with $x_S > x_{\Obs} \gg m$ and $y=5.355\, m$ gives an image on
$\Obs$'s screen at $b=5.355\, m$.
\end{remark}

of the Schwarzschild-Droste coordinates by $x=r\cos\ph$ and $y=r\sin\ph$.
$\w{P}$ is the photon momentum as measured by $\Obs_{\rm em}$.}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Link between the emission angle and the impact parameter}

In the above discussion, we have parameterized the null geodesics arriving
on the observer's screen by the impact parameter $b$. Let us relate the latter
to the emission angle in the source frame. To this aim, we consider that
the point source $S$, as depicted in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:mult_images}, is actually
the trace in the plane of the figure of the worldline of a static observer equipped
with a source of light, who we shall call the \emph{emitter} and denote
by $\Obs_{\rm em}$. Furthermore, we suppose that the rest frame of $\Obs_{\rm em}$
is an orthonormal tetrad
$\left(\w{u}_{\rm em}, \w{e}_{(r)}, \w{e}_{(\th)}, \w{e}_{(\ph)}\right)$ such
that the first spacelike vector, $\w{e}_{(r)}$, is always pointing towards the
black hole (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:gis:static_obs}).
Note that the first vector of the tetrad is necessarily the
4-velocity $\w{u}_{\rm em}$ of $\Obs_{\rm em}$. More precisely, we set
\begin{subequations}
\label{e:gis:bo_Obs_em}
\begin{align}
& \w{u}_{\rm em} = \left( 1 - \frac{2m}{r_{\rm em}} \right)^{-1/2} \wpar_t \\
& \w{e}_{(r)} = - \left( 1 - \frac{2m}{r_{\rm em}} \right)^{1/2} \wpar_r \\
& \w{e}_{(\th)} = - r_{\rm em}^{-1} \wpar_\th \\
& \w{e}_{(\ph)} = - r_{\rm em}^{-1} \wpar_\ph ,
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $(\wpar_t, \wpar_r, \wpar_\th, \wpar_\ph)$ is the natural basis associated
with Schwarzschild-Droste coordinates and $r_{\rm em}$ is the (constant) $r$-coordinate of
$\Obs_{\rm em}$, and hence of $\Obs_{\rm em}$.
It is immediate that $\left(\w{u}_{\rm em}, \w{e}_{(r)}, \w{e}_{(\th)}, \w{e}_{(\ph)}\right)$
is an orthonormal tetrad with respect to the Schwarzschild metric
(\ref{e:sch:Schwarz_metric_SD}). Moreover,
having a 4-velocity $\w{u}_{\rm em}$ collinear to the Killing vector $\wpar_t$
makes the observer $\Obs_{\rm em}$ static [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:u_Obs_xi})].

The generic 4-momentum $\w{p}$ of a photon evolving in the equatorial
plane $\th=\pi/2$ is given by Eqs.~(\ref{e:ges:comp_4_momentum}) and
(\ref{e:ges:dot_t_null})-(\ref{e:ges:dot_r_square_null}):
\be \label{e:gis:4mom_photon}
   \encadre{ \w{p} = E \left[ \left( 1 - \frac{2m}{r} \right)^{-1} \wpar_t
        \pm  \sqrt{ 1 - b^2 U(r) } \, \wpar_r
        + \eps_L  \frac{b}{r^2} \, \wpar_\ph \right] },
\ee
where we have used Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:eff_pot_null}) to let appear $U(r)$
and Eqs.~(\ref{e:ges:def_b})-(\ref{e:gis:def_epsilon_L}) to express\footnote{
Note that formula (\ref{e:gis:4mom_photon}) assumes $E\neq 0$, otherwise $b := |L|/E$ would
be ill-defined. As discussed in Sec.~\ref{s:gis:null_eff_pot}, the property $E\neq 0$,
and even $E>0$, holds as soon as the photon travels in the black hole's exterior.}
$L$ in terms of $E$ and $b$.
Taking the value of $\w{p}$ at the emission point $S$ and using (\ref{e:gis:bo_Obs_em})
to express $\wpar_t$, $\wpar_r$ and $\wpar_\ph$ in terms of
$\Obs_{\rm em}$'s orthonormal tetrad, we get
\be \label{e:gis:p_eps_u_em_n}
    \w{p} = \veps_{\rm em} \left( \w{u}_{\rm em} + \w{n} \right) ,
\ee
where
\be
    \veps_{\rm em} := - \w{u}_{\rm em} \cdot \w{p} =
        E \left( 1 - \frac{2m}{r_{\rm em}} \right)^{-1/2}
\ee
is the energy of the photon as measured by $\Obs_{\rm em}$ (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:fra:measure})
and
\be \label{e:gis:n_b_U_rS}
    \w{n} := \pm \sqrt{1 - b^2 U(r_{\rm em})} \, \w{e}_{(r)}
    - \eps_L b \sqrt{U(r_{\rm em})}\, \w{e}_{(\ph)}
\ee
is a unit spacelike vector orthogonal to $\w{u}_{\rm em}$:
$\w{n}\cdot\w{n} = 1$ and $\w{u}_{\rm em}\cdot\w{n} = 0$.

In view of (\ref{e:gis:p_eps_u_em_n}) and $\w{u}_{\rm em}\cdot\w{n} = 0$,
the linear momentum of the photon as measured by $\Obs_{\rm em}$ is
$\w{P} = \veps_{\rm em} \w{n}$ [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:fra:p_E_P}) and Fig.~\ref{f:gis:static_obs}].
We conclude that the unit vector $\w{n}$ gives the direction of emission
of the photon in $\Obs_{\rm em}$'s rest frame. Let us then define the \defin{emission
angle}\index{emission!angle} $\eta$ by
\be
    \w{n} = \cos\eta\, \w{e}_{(r)} + \sin\eta \, \w{e}_{(\ph)} .
\ee
Equation~(\ref{e:gis:n_b_U_rS}) yields immediately
\be \label{e:gis:cos_sin_eta_b}
 \cos\eta = \pm \sqrt{1 - b^2 U(r_{\rm em})} \qquad\mbox{and}\qquad
 \sin\eta = - \eps_L b \sqrt{U(r_{\rm em})} ,
\ee
from which we can express the impact parameter $b$ and
in terms of the emission angle $\eta$:
\be \label{e:gis:b_eta}
    \encadre{ b = -\eps_L \frac{\sin\eta}{\sqrt{U(r_{\rm em})}} }.
\ee
\begin{remark}
Equation~(\ref{e:gis:cos_sin_eta_b}) is well posed because
$U(r)\geq 0$ for $r>2m$ [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:eff_pot_null})]
and the equation
of motion (\ref{e:ges:dot_r_square_null_b}) implies $b^{-2} - U(r_{\rm em}) \geq 0$,
from which we get $0 \leq b^2 U(r_{\rm em}) \leq 1$.
\end{remark}

The variation of $b$ in terms of $\eta$ and $r_{\rm em}$, as given by formula (\ref{e:gis:b_eta}),
is depicted in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:b_eta}. We notice that the smallest range of $b$
is $[0, b_{\rm c})$ and is reached for $r_{\rm em} = 3m$, which is not surprising
in view of (\ref{e:gis:b_eta}) since the maximum of $U$ precisely occurs at $r=3m$
(cf. Fig.~\ref{f:gis:eff_pot_null}).

\subsubsection{Infinite sequence of images}

It appears clearly from Fig.~\ref{f:gis:b_eta}
that, whatever the location $r_{\rm em}$ of the emitter, including locations
inside the photon sphere ($r_{\rm em} < 3 m$), there always exist four
emission angles $\eta$ giving birth to impact parameters $b$ in the vicinity
of the critical value $b_{\rm c}$. These four angles can be gathered in two
pairs of angles of opposite directions: $(\eta_1, \eta_1+\pi)$ and
$(\eta_2, \eta_2+\pi)$. In each pair, only a single emission direction is prior to the
periastron for null geodesics with $b > b_{\rm c}$ and only a single emission
direction is outgoing and reaches infinity for $b < b_{\rm c}$. In other words,
on the four values of $\eta$, only two of them define geodesics that may reach
the asymptotic observer $\Obs$.

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{gis_A_rem.pdf}}
\caption[]{\label{f:gis:A_rem} \footnotesize
Function $A(r_{\rm em})$ defined by Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:def_A_rem}).
The dashed line marks the horizontal asymptote $A = 648(7\sqrt{3} - 12) \simeq 80.58246$.
\textsl{[Figure produced with the notebook \ref{s:sam:gis_emission}]}
}
\end{figure}


Let $\ph_{\rm em}\in {[0, 2\pi)}$ be the $\ph$ coordinate of the emitter $\Obs_{\rm em}$.
A null geodesic emitted by $\Obs_{\rm em}$ reaches the asymptotic observer $\Obs$, who is located at $\ph=0$, iff $\ph_\infty = 0 \mod 2\pi$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:ph_inf_0_mod_2pi})],
i.e. iff
\be \label{e:gis:ph_inf_2pi_n}
    \ph_\infty = 2\pi\eps_L n, \qquad n\in\mathbb{N} .
\ee
The above formula takes into account the fact that the sign of $\ph_\infty$
is that of $L$, hence the factor $\eps_L$ and $n\geq 0$.
From Fig.~\ref{f:gis:phi_inf_em_b}, we see that values $n \geq 1$ can be
reached iff either (i) $r_{\rm em} > 3m$, $b$ is close to $b_{\rm c}$ from above and $\tlamb_{\rm em} < \tlamb_{\rm p}$ or (ii) $r_{\rm em} < 3m$ and $b$ is close to
$b_{\rm c}$ from below.
In the first case, we may use the approximate formula
(\ref{e:gis:ph_inf_ph_em_lim_b_gt_bc}) with $u_{\rm em} = m/r_{\rm em}$, while in the second
case formula (\ref{e:gis:ph_inf_lim_b_lt_bc_u_gt_us}) is relevant.
Inserting (\ref{e:gis:ph_inf_2pi_n}) in either of these formulas, we get
\be \label{e:gis:2pin_Aem}
     2\pi\eps_L n = \ph_{\rm em}
   + \eps_L \ln \left( A(r_{\rm em})  \frac{m}{b - b_{\rm c}} \right) ,
\ee
with (cf. Remark~\ref{r:gis:prefactor_b_bc}, page~\pageref{r:gis:prefactor_b_bc})
\be \label{e:gis:def_A_rem}
   \encadre{ A(r_{\rm em})  :=
    \frac{648(2\sqrt{3} - 3)(r_{\rm em} - 3 m)}{2 r_{\rm em} + 3 m
    + \sqrt{3r_{\rm em}(r_{\rm em} + 6 m)}} } .
\ee
Note that $A(r_{\rm em})  > 0$ for $r_{\rm em} > 3 m$ and
$A(r_{\rm em})  < 0$ for $r_{\rm em} < 3 m$. Taking into account
that $b - b_{\rm c} > 0$ for case (i) and $b - b_{\rm c} < 0$ for case (ii),
we check that
the argument of the logarithm in Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:2pin_Aem}) is always
positive.
Equation~(\ref{e:gis:2pin_Aem}) can be solved for $b$:
\[
    b = b_{\rm c} + m A(r_{\rm em})  \mathrm{e}^{\eps_L \ph_{\rm em} - 2\pi n},
\]
which we may write $b = b_n^+$ or $b_n^-$, denoting the solution with $\eps_L=+1$ by $b_n^+$
and that with $\eps_L=-1$ by $b_n^-$:
\begin{subequations}
\label{e:gis:bn_sequence}
\begin{align}
& \encadre{b_n^+ = b_{\rm c} + m A(r_{\rm em})\, \mathrm{e}^{\ph_{\rm em} - 2\pi n}},\quad
n\in \mathbb{N}^* \\
& \encadre{b_n^- := b_{\rm c} + m A(r_{\rm em})\,  \mathrm{e}^{- \ph_{\rm em} - 2\pi n}},\quad
n\in \mathbb{N}^* .
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
The function $A(r_{\rm em})$ is plotted in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:A_rem}.
It varies monotonically between
\[
\lim_{r_{\rm em}\to 2m} A(r_{\rm em}) = \underbrace{- 648(26\sqrt{3} - 45)}_{\simeq -21.59201}
\quad\mbox{and}\quad
\lim_{r_{\rm em}\to +\infty} A(r_{\rm em}) = \underbrace{648(7\sqrt{3} - 12)}_{\simeq 80.58246}.
\]
One shall recall that formulas (\ref{e:gis:bn_sequence}) have been derived
under the assumption $|b - b_{\rm c}| \ll m$. Given the amplitude of $A(r_{\rm em})$
shown in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:A_rem} and the value $\mathrm{e}^{-2\pi} \simeq 1.9\times 10^{-3}$,
this is valid for any $n\geq 1$, except maybe for $b_n^+$ with $n=1$ and $\ph_{\rm em}$
large (i.e. close to $2\pi$).

Via Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:b_eta}), the two sequences (\ref{e:gis:bn_sequence}) of the impact parameter $b$
correspond to two sequences of the emission angle $\eta$:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
&\sin\eta_n^+ := - \sqrt{U(r_{\rm em})}
\left( b_{\rm c} + m A(r_{\rm em})  \mathrm{e}^{\ph_{\rm em} - 2\pi n} \right), \quad
n\in \mathbb{N}^* \\
&\sin\eta_n^- := \sqrt{U(r_{\rm em})}
\left( b_{\rm c} + m A(r_{\rm em})  \mathrm{e}^{-\ph_{\rm em} - 2\pi n} \right),
\quad n\in \mathbb{N}^*.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
Note that $0 \leq b_{\rm c} \sqrt{U(r_{\rm em})} \leq 1$ and
$b_{\rm c} \sqrt{U(r_{\rm em})} = 1 \iff r_{\rm em} = 3m$.
As discussed above (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:gis:b_eta}), for $r_{\rm em} \not= 3m$,
there are always some solutions for $\eta_n^+$ and $\eta_n^-$ for $n$
sufficiently large (in practice, $n\geq 1$). We therefore conclude:
\begin{prop}[images of a point source]
Any static point source $S$ give birth to two infinite sequences of images
on the screen of the asymptotic observer $\Obs$, at the effective distances
from the screen's center
$(b_n^+)_{n\in\mathbb{N}^*}$ and $(b_n^-)_{n\in\mathbb{N}^*}$, as
given by Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:bn_sequence}).
If $S$, $\Obs$ and the black hole are not aligned, i.e. if
$\ph_{\rm em} \not\in\{0, \pi\}$,
all the images of $S$ are aligned on $\Obs$'s screen: they
all lie in the plane defined by $S$, $\Obs$ and the black hole (plane of
Fig.~\ref{f:gis:mult_images}). If $S$ is located outside the photon sphere
($r_{\rm em} > 3m$), all images lie outside the circle $b=b_{\rm c}$ on $\Obs$'s screen,
while if $S$ is located inside the photon sphere ($r_{\rm em} < 3m$),
all images lie inside that circle. In both cases,
the images of the sequence $(b_n^+)_{n\in\mathbb{N}^*}$ (positive $L$)
are located on the opposite side of those of the sequence
$(b_n^-)_{n\in\mathbb{N}^*}$ (negative $L$). The higher $n$, the closer
the images $b_n^+$ and $b_n^-$ to the circle $b=b_{\rm c}$. Actually,
according to the laws (\ref{e:gis:bn_sequence}),
each sequence converge exponentially fast to that circle. From $n$ to $n+1$,
the distance to the circle is reduced by a factor
$\mathrm{e}^{- 2\pi}\simeq 1.9\times 10^{-3}$.
\end{prop}

\begin{remark}
The alignment of the images is a direct consequence of the spherical
symmetry of Schwarzschild spacetime.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
The reader may be puzzled by the compatibility between an infinite number
of images from a single source and the conservation of energy. There is
actually no issue here because one can show that the images are
fainter as $n$ increases. So in practice, only a few images would be visible.
\end{remark}

\end{figure}


\subsection{Aligned source and Einstein rings}

In the special case where the source is located on the $x$-axis, the images form
a series of concentric circles accumulating from above on the circle
$b = b_{\rm c}$. This is illustrated by the source $A$ in
Fig.~\ref{f:gis:images_aligned}. Four geodesics through the source are drawn,
given birth to four images that
are symmetric with respect to the $x$-axis, labelled 1, 3 and 2, 4 respectively.
Since in this case the plane of the figure is not privileged (one cannot speak
about the plane defined by $A$, $\Obs$ and the black hole, since they are aligned);
we deduce by rotation about the $x$-axis that $A$ generates images all along
circles centered on the origin in $\Obs$'s screen. Images 1 and 2 in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:images_aligned}
lie actually on the same circle, as well as images 3 and 4.
As for the non-aligned case, Fig.~\ref{f:gis:images_aligned} shows only a limited number of
images, but there is actually an infinite number of such images: the full image
of $A$ on $\Obs$'s screen is composed by a infinite sequence $(\mathscr{C}_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$
of concentric circles
that accumulate exponentially fast onto the circle of radius $b = b_{\rm c}$.
Each circle $\mathscr{C}_n$ has a radius $b_n$ that is given
by Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:bn_sequence}) with $\ph_{\rm em} = 0$ or $\pi$ (case of
Fig.~\ref{f:gis:images_aligned}), so that $b_n^+ = b_n^- =: b_n$ (case $\ph_{\rm em} = 0$)
or $b_n^+ = b_{n-1}^- =: b_n$ (case $\ph_{\rm em} = \pi$).
The outermost circle, $\mathscr{C}_0$, is called the
\defin{Einstein ring of}\index{Einstein!ring}\index{ring!Einstein --} $A$.
It is the only significant ring in astronomical images involving \emph{gravitational
lensing}\index{gravitational!lensing} by a massive foreground source (not necessarily
a black hole), which are in the context $|x_A|\gg m$ and $b\gg m$.
We may call $\mathscr{C}_n$ the $\bm{n^{\rm th}}$\defin{~Einstein ring of} $A$.
For $n\geq 1$, $\mathscr{C}_n$ is also called a \defin{relativistic Einstein ring of}
$A$. Indeed, these rings exist only in the case of a very relativistic central object, so that
photons can wind around it. On the contrary $\mathscr{C}_0$ exists even for non-relativistic
objects. In particular, in astronomical observations of Einstein rings performed up
to now, the central deflecting object is a galaxy or a galaxy cluster,
both being highly non-relativistic (very low compactness).

\begin{hist} \label{h:gis:seq_images_Darwin}
The infinite sequence of images of a point source located at $r>3m$, with accumulation just outside the circle $b=b_{\rm c}$, has been predicted in 1959 by
Charles Galton Darwin\index[pers]{Darwin, C.G.} \cite{Darwi59}
(cf. historical note on p.~\pageref{h:gis:Darwin_formula}). Darwin has
also derived the sequence of relativistic Einstein rings for aligned sources.
\end{hist}


\subsection{Black hole shadow} \label{s:gis:shadow}

Let us determine the image on observer $\Obs$'s screen
when all the sources of light are very far, both
from the black hole and from $\Obs$. We may think of many stars
shining on the celestial sphere. To simplify the problem, we shall assume
that the black hole and the observer are surrounded by a distant
sphere $\mathscr{S}$ that is uniformly bright. In such a setting,
all values of $b > b_{\rm c}$ on $\Obs$'s screen, whatever the polar angle $\alpha$,
correspond to a null geodesic that originates from the shining sphere $\mathscr{S}$, while
this is not possible for $b \leq b_{\rm c}$.
This is clear on Fig.~\ref{f:gis:mult_images}: when traced backward from the right
($\Obs$ position), (i) null geodesics with $b > b_{\rm c}$ eventually end
up far away from the black hole, i.e. necessarily on $\mathscr{S}$, (ii) null geodesics
with $b < b_{\rm c}$ end up infinitely close to the black hole horizon
and (iii) null geodesics with $b = b_{\rm c}$ roll up indefinitely around
the photon sphere (cf. Figs.~\ref{f:gis:null_b_crit_from_inf_L_pos} and
\ref{f:gis:null_b_crit_from_inf_L_neg}).

The same conclusion can be reached
by considering the effective potential diagram in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:eff_pot_null}.
For concreteness, imagine that $\Obs$ is located at $r=15 m$ and that
the shining sphere $\mathscr{S}$ has a coordinate radius $r=20 m$.
These values allow us to put $\Obs$ and $\mathscr{S}$
in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:eff_pot_null} according
to our settings ($\mathscr{S}$ is encompassing both $\Obs$ and the black
hole), but one shall keep in mind that both $\Obs$ and $\mathscr{S}$
are assumed to lie at much larger values of $r$ (fulfilling $r\gg m$).
Only two kinds of geodesic
trajectories in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:eff_pot_null} diagram can reach $r = 15m$ ($\Obs$'s screen) with increasing values
of $r$ (the direction of observation): those of type 1 and those of type 3.
The latter ones originate necessarily from a region between the black hole
horizon and $\Obs$'s location, i.e. a region that does not intersect $\mathscr{S}$.
On the contrary, all the geodesics of type 1 must have had $r = 20 m$
in their past history, i.e. we may consider that they all have been emitted
by $\mathscr{S}$ inwards and have bounced on the potential barrier before
reaching $\Obs$'s screen in their outward motion.

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{gis_shadow.pdf}}

Shadow of a Schwarzschild black hole. The dashed grey circle delimitates the
dark disk that would appear on the screen of an observer looking at
a black sphere of radius $r=2m$ in Minkowski spacetime. The ratio between
the radii of the two disks is $b_{\rm c} / 2m = 3\sqrt{3}/2 \simeq 2.60$.}
\end{figure}


Both reasonings, that based on Fig.~\ref{f:gis:mult_images} and that
based on Fig.~\ref{f:gis:eff_pot_null}, led us to conclude that
\begin{prop}[shadow of a Schwarzschild black hole]
For a distant observer, the image of a uniformly bright sphere $\mathscr{S}$ surrounding
the black hole and the observer is a bright area fulfilling
the observer's screen, except for a central black disk of radius $b=b_{\rm c}$
(cf. Fig.~\ref{f:gis:shadow}).
This disk is called the
\defin{black hole shadow}\index{black!hole!shadow}\index{shadow!black hole --}.
\end{prop}

\begin{hist} \label{h:gis:bh_shadow}
In his 1921 treatise \cite{Laue1921}, Max von Laue\index[pers]{von Laue, M.}
noted that an emitting sphere of radius $r_0$ such that $2m < r_0 < 3m$ will
appear as having a radius of $3\sqrt{3} m$ $(=b_{\rm c})$ to a distant observer,
independently of the value of $r_0$.
Maybe the first mention of a shadow lies in the article by
Charles Galton Darwin\index[pers]{Darwin, C.G.} in 1959 \cite{Darwi59}. Actually,
Darwin imagined that the source of the Schwarzschild metric is a massive
point particle, called by him the ``sun'', and wrote
\emph{``suppose that there is a roughly uniform star-field all round the sky, and
consider what will be seen and mapped from the telescope... To the area inside
this circle} (the circle $b=b_{\rm c}$) \emph{only the sun itself can contribute light. The most obvious assumption is
that its rays would emerge in straight lines, so that there would be a brilliant point of
light surrounded by blackness''}. In the full black hole context, the first
computation of the shadow has been presented by James M.~Bardeen\index[pers]{Bardeen, J.M.}
at the famous Les Houches summer school of
1972 \cite{Barde73a}; the shadow is called the \emph{apparent shape of the black hole}
by Bardeen and the computation has been performed for the Kerr black hole,
which generalizes the Schwarzschild black hole to the rotating case (cf. Chap.~\ref{s:ker}); this
Kerr black hole shadow will be discussed in details in Sec.~\ref{s:gik:shadow}.
\end{hist}

\subsection{Image of an accretion disk} \label{s:gis:image_disk}

A realistic ``source of light'' in the vicinity of a black hole is an
accretion disk\index{accretion!disk} \cite{AbramF13,King23}. Actually most of astronomical
observations of black holes in the electromagnetic domain are measurements
about an accretion disk, either a spectrum or an image, like the image
of M87* released in 2019 by the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration
\cite{EHT19a}. The matter (mostly hydrogen) constituting the accretion disk
arises either from a companion star (stellar-mass black hole in a binary
system, like Cyg X-1, cf. Table~\ref{t:ges:time_free_fall})
or from gas clouds in a galactic center (supermassive black holes, like
Sgr~A* and M87*, cf. Table~\ref{t:ges:time_free_fall}).

Figure~\ref{f:gis:disk_images} shows various views of an accretion disk
around a Schwarzschild black hole as seen by a distant observer.
The accretion disk is a model
developed by Novikov \& Thorne \cite{NovikT73} and Page \& Thorne \cite{PageT74},
lying in some plane around the black hole.
It is geometrically thin but optically thick.
The inner radius of the disk
is the innermost stable circular orbit\index{stable!circular orbit} (ISCO)\index{ISCO}
at $r=6m$ (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:ges:circular_orbits}). The images shown in
Fig.~\ref{f:gis:disk_images} have been computed by the open-source ray-tracing code
\textsf{Gyoto}\index{Gyoto} \cite{VincePGP11} (cf. Appendix~\ref{s:gyo}).
This code integrates the null geodesic equations backward, starting from the observer's
screen. For Fig.~\ref{f:gis:disk_images}, the observer is located at $r=1000\, m$
and at various inclination angles $\iota$ with respect to the accretion disk,
ranging from $\iota=0$ (disk seen face-on) to
$\iota=3/2$ (disk seen almost edge-on).
The colors in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:disk_images} encode the flux at a fixed wavelength.

Formation of the primary (orange), secondary (brown) and tertiary (red)
images of an accretion disk when viewed face-on. The figure plane
is orthogonal to the disk plane, the intersection between the two planes being
the $y$-axis, so that disk is depicted by the thick segments located at $\ph=\pi/2$
and $\ph=3\pi/2$.
As in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:disk_images}, the inner boundary of the disk is
$r_{\rm in} = 6\, m$ (the ISCO), but the outer boundary has been truncated at
$r_{\rm out} = 9\, m$ for pedagogical purposes.
The observer is located at $x\gg m$ and $y=0$.
The dashed green circle is the photon orbit at $r=3\, m$.
The lower panel shows the geodesics emerging from the inner and outer edges
of the upper part of the disk.

Let us first discuss the face-on view (upper-left panel of Fig.~\ref{f:gis:disk_images}).
To interpret it, some null geodesics generating it have been depicted
in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:disk_face_on}. One may distinguish three images of the accretion disk:
\begin{itemize}
\item the \emph{primary image}, which is formed by the outermost bright part; it is
generated by null geodesics that suffers a small deflection from the disk to
the observer; more precisely, they are arising from the side of the disk facing
the observer and have
$\Delta\ph = \pm \pi/2$ in their trajectory plane (cf. orange curves in
Fig.~\ref{f:gis:disk_face_on}); the inner boundary of the
primary image is the image of the ISCO under these geodesics; it is located
at $b = 6.932\, m$ on the observer's screen;
\item the \emph{secondary image}, which is the bright yellow ring separated
from the inner boundary of the primary image by the thick black annulus; this
image is generated by null geodesics that perform half a turn around the
photon sphere before reaching the observer;  more precisely,
they are arising from the side of the disk \emph{opposite} to
the observer and have
$\Delta\ph = \pm 3\pi/2$ in their trajectory plane (cf. brown curves in
Fig.~\ref{f:gis:disk_face_on}); the inner boundary of the secondary image
is located at $b = 5.479\, m$ on the observer's screen;
\item the \emph{tertiary image}, which is the thin faint innermost ring;
this image is generated by null geodesics that perform a full turn around
the photon sphere before reaching the observer; more precisely,
they are arising from the side of the disk facing
the observer and have
$\Delta\ph = \pm 5\pi/2$ in their trajectory plane (cf. red curves in
Fig.~\ref{f:gis:disk_face_on}); the inner boundary of the tertiary image
is located at $b = 5.208\, m$ on the observer's screen.
\end{itemize}
As discussed in Sec.~\ref{s:gis:images_point}, there are actually an infinite
number of images of the accretion disk but they are more and more faint and
only three of them are visible in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:disk_images}. Moreover
these images are formed by exponentially thinner rings and accumulate near the circle $b = b_{\rm c}$. In Figs.~\ref{f:gis:disk_images} and \ref{f:gis:disk_face_on}, the tertiary image corresponds
to $n=2$ for $\epsilon_L = 1$ and $n=1$ for $\epsilon_L = -1$
in Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:ph_inf_2pi_n}) \footnote{This asymmetry of $n$ with respect to
$\epsilon_L$ is
due to the convention $\ph_{\rm em}\in{[0,2\pi)}$;
had we chosen $\ph_{\rm em}\in{(-\pi, \pi]}$, it would not be present.}, so that Eqs.~(\ref{e:gis:bn_sequence})
with $\ph_{\rm em} = \pi/2$ ($b = b_1^-$) and $\ph_{\rm em} = 3\pi/2$ ($b = b_2^+$)
yield $(b - b_{\rm c})/b_{\rm c} = A(r_{\rm em}) \mathrm{e}^{-5\pi/2}/(3\sqrt{3})$. With $r_{\rm em} = 6 m$,
we have $A(r_{\rm em}) \simeq 30.3$, so that $(b - b_{\rm c})/b_{\rm c} \simeq 0.0013$
for the tertiary image. This we may conclude that,  up to a relative accuracy of $10^{-3}$,
the interior of the tertiary image
corresponds to the black hole shadow as defined in Sec.~\ref{s:gis:shadow},

For a nonzero inclination angle, the images shown in Fig.~\ref{f:gis:disk_images}
exhibit some asymmetry between the left and the right. This is due to the
rotation of the disk at relativistic speed, which generates a strong Doppler
boost, making the left part of the disk, which moves towards the observer,
much brighter than the right part, which recedes from the observer.
Note that for the three views with $\iota\not=0$, the primary, secondary and
tertiary images are still present but are no longer circular rings.
Note that the almost edge-on view is drastically different from what would
get in flat (Minkowski) spacetime, since for the latter the accretion disk
would appear as a very thin ellipsoidal shape elongated along the
horizontal axis.

\begin{hist} \label{h:gis:bh_images}
The first computation of the image of an accretion disk around a Schwarzschild black hole
has been performed by
Jean-Pierre Luminet\index[pers]{Luminet, J.-P.} in 1979 \cite{Lumin79}, (see Ref.~\cite{Lumin19} for
an historical account). The accretion disk was the same Page-Thorne model
as that considered here and Luminet obtained an image pretty close
to that of the last quadrant of Fig~\ref{f:gis:disk_images}, the difference
lying in the inclination angle: $\iota = 80^\circ \simeq 1.40 {\rm\; rad}$
versus $\iota = 1.50 {\rm\; rad}$ in Fig~\ref{f:gis:disk_images}.
In 1991, Jean-Alain Marck\index[pers]{Marck, J.-A.} computed the first movie of an observer plunging
into a Schwarzschild black endowed with an accretion disk \cite{Marck91,Marck96}.
In 2007, Alain Riazuelo\index[pers]{Riazuelo, A.} computed very precise images of a
Schwarzschild black hole in front of a realistic stellar field \cite{Riazu08,Riazu19},
which illustrate magnificently the multiple character of images of stars (Sec.~\ref{s:gis:images_point})
and the concept of black hole shadow (Sec.~\ref{s:gis:shadow})
(cf. Appendix~\ref{s:web}).
