\section{Introduction}

Having discussed in depth the geometry of null hypersurfaces in Chap.~\ref{s:def}
we move forward to distinguish a null hypersurface representing a black hole event horizon from, let us say, that representing a mere future light cone. We do it here for black holes
\emph{in equilibrium}. Indeed, for such objects, it is quite natural
to assume a vanishing expansion. This leads us to the concept of \emph{non-expanding
horizon} (Sec.~\ref{s:neh:neh}). A special kind of these objects is that
of \emph{Killing horizons}, which occur in spacetimes that are globally
stationary (Secs.~\ref{s:neh:Killing_hor} and \ref{s:sta:bifur_Killing_hor}). Actually, we shall
see in Chap.~\ref{s:sta} that, under some rather general hypotheses, the event horizon of a black hole in equilibrium
must be a Killing horizon.

\section{Non-expanding horizons} \label{s:neh:neh}

\subsection{Motivation and definition} \label{s:neh:def}

In Chap.~\ref{s:def}, the null hypersurfaces have been introduced as boundaries
of black holes, from the ``no-escape'' aspect of the naive definition given in
Sec.~\ref{s:def:first_defin}. To enforce the ``localized'' facet of the definition,
we could demand that the cross-sections are closed (compact without boundary\footnote{Cf. the discussion in Sec.~\ref{s:def:spacelike_sections}.})
and have a constant area, i.e. a vanishing expansion. Hence the definition:
\begin{greybox}
A \defin{non-expanding horizon}\index{non-expanding horizon}\index{horizon!non-expanding --} is a null hypersurface $\Hor$ having the
topology
\be \label{e:neh:H_topology}
    \Hor \simeq \R \times \Sp,
\ee
where $\Sp$ is a closed manifold\index{closed!manifold} of dimension $n-2$,
and such that the expansion of $\Hor$ along any null normal $\wl$ vanishes
identically:
\be
    \theta_{(\wl)} = 0 .
\ee
\end{greybox}

\begin{remark}
Given the scaling law (\ref{e:def:rescale_lambda}),
if $\theta_{(\wl)} = 0$ for some normal $\wl$, then  $\theta_{(\wl')} = 0$
for any other normal $\wl'$. Hence the definition of a non-expanding horizon
does not depend on the choice of the null normal.
\end{remark}

The above definition captures only
the event horizon of black holes in equilibrium, to be discussed in detail
in Chap.~\ref{s:sta}.
For a black hole out of equilibrium, one has generically $\theta_{(\wl)} > 0$,
as we shall see in Chap.~\ref{s:evo}.

\begin{example}[Schwarzschild horizon]
In view of Eq.~(\ref{e:def:theta_Schw_hor}), we may assert that the
Schwarz\-schild horizon considered in Examples~\ref{x:def:Schw_hor}, \ref{x:def:Schw_hor2},
\ref{x:def:Schw_hor3}, \ref{x:def:Schw_hor4}, \ref{x:def:Schw_hor5}, \ref{x:def:Schw_hor6},
\ref{x:def:Schw_hor7}, \ref{x:def:Schw_hor8} and \ref{x:def:Schw_hor9}
of Chap.~\ref{s:def}
is a non-expanding horizon.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[null hyperplane and light cone as counter-examples]
The null hyperplane and light cone in Minkowski spacetime considered
in the examples of Chap.~\ref{s:def} are excluded by the above definition,
having non-compact cross-sections (null hyperplane) or nonzero expansion
(light cone).
\end{example}

\begin{hist}\label{h:neh:NEH}
The concept of non-expanding horizon has been introduced by
Petr~H\'a\'\j i\v{c}ek\index[pers]{Hajicek, P.@Ha\'\j i\v{c}ek, P.}
in 1973 under the name of \emph{totally geodesic null hypersurface} \cite{Hajic73a}
or \emph{perfect horizon} \cite{Hajic73b,Hajic74}.
The terminology \emph{non-expanding horizon} is due to
Abhay Ashtekar\index[pers]{Ashtekar, A.}, Stephen Fairhurst\index[pers]{Fairhurst, S.}
and Badri Krishnan\index[pers]{Krishnan, B.} in 2000 \cite{AshteFK00} (see also \cite{AshteBL02}).
\end{hist}

\subsection{Invariance of the area} \label{s:neh:invar_area}

Given a complete cross-section $\Sp$ of $\Hor$, the area\index{area!of a cross-section} of $\Sp$, with respect to the spacetime metric $\w{g}$, is [cf. Eqs.~(\ref{e:def:A_wepsS_dx}) and (\ref{e:def:A_sqrt_q})]
\be \label{e:neh:total_area}
    A = \int_{\Sp} \wepsS(\D\w{x}_{(2)},\ldots,\D\w{x}_{(n-1)})
        = \int_{\Sp} \sqrt{q} \, \D x^2 \cdots \D x^{n-1} ,
\ee
where $x^a = (x^2, \ldots, x^{n-1})$ is a coordinate system on $\Sp$ and $q$ is
the determinant with respect to these coordinates of the Riemannian metric $\w{q}$
induced by $\w{g}$ on $\Sp$.

\begin{prop}[area of a non-expanding horizon]
\label{p:neh:invariance_area}
The area $A$ does not depend on the choice of the complete cross-section $\Sp$
of $\Hor$.
For this reason, $A$ is
called the \defin{area of the non-expanding horizon}\index{area!of a non-expanding horizon}
$\Hor$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Let $\Sp'$ be a second complete cross-section of $\Hor$. Let us assume first that
$\Sp'\cap\Sp = \varnothing$. Then each null geodesic generator $\Li$ of $\Hor$ intersects
$\Sp$ and $\Sp'$ in two distinct points and it is possible to chose a parameter
$\lambda$ of $\Li$ such that $\lambda=0$ on $\Sp$ and $\lambda=1$ on $\Sp'$.
Let $\wl = \left. \D\w{x}/\D\lambda \right| _{\Li}$ be the associated tangent vector.
We may then say that the cross-section $\Sp'$ is deduced
from $\Sp$ by the Lie dragging of $\Sp$ along $\wl$ by the parameter increase $\delta\lambda=1$.
More precisely, we may consider that $\Sp'$ is deduced from $\Sp$ by a
continuous deformation, represented by a 1-parameter family $(\Sp_{\lambda})$
of cross-sections such that $\Sp_0 = \Sp$ and $\Sp_1 = \Sp'$. Associated
with this family is a real-valued function $\lambda \mapsto A(\lambda)$
given the area of each element $\Sp_{\lambda}$. By the very definition
of the expansion along $\wl$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:def:def_expansion})], we have then
\[
    \frac{\D A}{\D\lambda} = \int_{\Sp_{\lambda}} \theta_{(\wl)} \, \delta A .
\]
If $\Hor$ is a non-expanding horizon, then $\theta_{(\wl)}=0$ and it follows
that $A(\lambda)$ is a constant function. Hence the area of $\Sp'$ is equal
to that of $\Sp$. If $\Sp$ and $\Sp'$ have a non-empty intersecting part,
the argument can be repeated on each of the non-intersecting parts, given
that the area of the part $\Sp\cap\Sp'$ is obviously the same for $\Sp$
and $\Sp'$.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}[Schwarzschild horizon] \label{x:neh:Schwarz_hor_area}
The area of the Schwarzschild horizon is readily computed from
the metric (\ref{e:def:q_S_Schw_hor}):
$\w{q} = 4m^2 \left( \dd\th^2 + \sin^2\th \, \dd\ph^2 \right)$, yielding
$\sqrt{q}=4m^2$;
we get
\be \label{e:neh:area_Schwarz}
     A = 16\pi m^2 .
\ee
\end{example}

\subsection{Trapped surfaces} \label{s:neh:trapped_surfaces}

If there exists some natural concept of \emph{outer}/\emph{inner} region with respect
to $\Hor$, for
instance the outer region being the one having some asymptotically flat end,
and if the transverse null normals $\w{k}$ to cross-sections point to the inner region, then
the property $\theta_{(\wl)}=0$ means that any cross-section $\Sp$ of the
non-expanding horizon $\Hor$ is a
\defin{marginally outer trapped surface}\index{marginally!outer trapped surface}\index{trapped!surface!marginally outer --}
(often abridged as \defin{MOTS}\index{MOTS}). This definition is due to
Hawking \cite{Hawki73}, an
\defin{outer trapped surface}\index{outer!trapped surface}\index{trapped!surface!outer --}
would be one for which $\theta_{(\wl)}\leq 0$.

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=0.52\textwidth]{neh_untrapped_surf.pdf}
}
\caption[]{\label{f:neh:trapped_surf} \footnotesize
Trapped surface (left): $\delta A^{(\wl)}_\varepsilon  < \delta A$
and untrapped surface (right): $\delta A^{(\wl)}_\varepsilon  > \delta A$,
both surfaces having $\delta A^{(\w{k})}_\varepsilon  < \delta A$.
}
\end{figure}


The MOTS definition is related to, but distinct from, the definition of a
marginally trapped surface by Penrose \cite{Penro65}: a $(n-2)$-dimensional
submanifold $\Sp$ of $\M$ is a \defin{trapped surface}\index{trapped!surface}
 iff (i) $\Sp$ is
closed (i.e. compact without boundary), (ii) $\Sp$ is spacelike and (iii)
the two systems of null geodesics emerging orthogonally from $\Sp$ towards the future
converge locally at $\Sp$, i.e. they have negative expansions:
\be \label{e:neh:def_trapped_surf}
    \theta_{(\wl)} < 0 \quad\mbox{and}\quad \theta_{(\w{k})} < 0 ,
\ee
where the expansion along $\w{k}$ is defined in the same way as that along
$\wl$ [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:def:theta_l_all})]:
\be \label{e:neh:expansion_k}
    \theta_{(\w{k})} := \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{\varepsilon}
    \frac{\delta A^{(\w{k})}_\varepsilon - \delta A}{\delta A}
        = \frac{1}{2} \Lie{\w{k}} \ln q
        = \frac{1}{2} \, q^{\mu\nu} \Liec{k} q_{\mu\nu}
        = q^{\mu\nu} \nabla_\mu k_\nu ,
\ee
$\delta A^{(\w{k})}_\varepsilon$ being the area of the surface element
that is deduced from the surface element of area $\delta A$ on $\Sp$ by the
Lie dragging along $\w{k}$ by a parameter $\varepsilon$ (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:neh:trapped_surf}).
The limit case $\theta_{(\wl)} = 0$ and $\theta_{(\w{k})}<0$ correspond
to the so-called \defin{marginally trapped surface}\index{marginally!trapped surface}\index{trapped!surface!marginally --}.
In flat spacetime (Minkowski), given any closed spacelike surface,
one has $\theta_{(\wl)} > 0$ and $\theta_{(\w{k})} < 0$ (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:neh:trapped_surf} right), so there is no trapped surface. We shall discuss trapped surfaces in more
detail in Sec.~\ref{s:loc:trapped_surf}.

Cross-sections of a non-expanding horizon are usually marginally trapped surfaces
(cf. the example below).
However, there exist some pathological situations for
which $\theta_{(\w{k})} > 0$ at some points of $\Sp$ \cite{GerocH82}.

\begin{example}
Let us consider a cross-section $\Sp$ of the Schwarzschild horizon as
defined in Example~\ref{x:def:Schw_hor4} of Chap.~\ref{s:def}.
Computing $q^{\mu\nu} \nabla_\mu k_\nu$ from the components $k_\nu$
given by (\ref{e:def:l_k_forms_Schw_hor}), we get (cf. the notebook~\ref{s:sam:Schwarz_hor} for
the computation) $\theta_{(\w{k})} = - (r+2m)/r^2$.
In particular, on $\Sp$ ($r=2m$), $\theta_{(\w{k})}  = - 1/m$.
Hence $\theta_{(\w{k})} < 0$. Since we had already $\theta_{(\wl)}=0$
[cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:def:theta_Schw_hor})], we conclude that $\Sp$ is a
marginally trapped surface. This could also have been inferred from
Fig.~\ref{f:def:Schw_hor_lk}, since according to the metric
(\ref{e:def:q_Schw_hor}), the area of the cross-sections of $\Hor$
is nothing but $4\pi r^2$ and $\w{k}$ points to decreasing values of $r$, while, on $\Hor$,
$\wl$ points to a fixed value of $r$.
\end{example}

\subsection{Vanishing of the deformation rate tensor}

If $\Hor$ is a non-expanding horizon, we may set $\theta_{(\wl)}=0$
in the null Raychaudhuri equation (\ref{e:def:null_Raychaud_Ricci}); it reduces then
to
\be \label{e:neh:null_Raychaud_theta_zero}
    \sigma_{ab} \sigma^{ab} + \w{R}(\wl, \wl) = 0 ,
\ee
where $\w{R}$ is the Ricci tensor of the metric $\w{g}$.
Let us assume that the null convergence condition
discussed in Sec.~\ref{s:def:null_convergence_cond}
holds: $\w{R}(\wl, \wl) \geq 0$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:null_energy_cond})].
Then, given the property $\sigma_{ab} \sigma^{ab} \geq 0$
[Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:sigma_square})],
Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:null_Raychaud_theta_zero}) implies both
$\sigma_{ab} \sigma^{ab}  = 0$
and
\be \label{e:neh:R_l_l_zero}
    \encadre{ \w{R}(\wl, \wl) = 0  }.
\ee
The identity $\sigma_{ab} \sigma^{ab} = 0$ is possible only if each of
the terms $\sigma_{ab}$ in the sum (\ref{e:neh:sigma_square_si}) is zero. Hence we have necessarily
$\w{\sigma} = 0$.
Since we had already $\theta_{(\wl)}=0$ ($\Hor$ non-expanding), this implies that the full deformation rate tensor
$\w{\Theta}$
vanishes identically [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:def:def_shear})]. Moreover,
given the scaling law (\ref{e:def:rescale_deform_shear}), this holds for
any null normal $\wl$. We can thus conclude:

\begin{prop}[invariance of the cross-section metric along the null generators]
\label{p:neh:invariance_of_2metric}
Provided that the null convergence condition\index{null!convergence condition}\index{convergence!condition!null --} (\ref{e:neh:null_energy_cond})
holds --- which occurs in general relativity if the
null energy condition\index{null!energy condition}\index{energy!condition!null --}
(\ref{e:neh:null_energy_cond_matter})
holds ---,
the deformation rate of any cross-section $\Sp$ of a non-expanding horizon $\Hor$
along any null normal $\wl$ is identically zero:
\be \label{e:neh:Lie_el_q_zero}
    \encadre{ \w{\Theta} := \frac{1}{2} \vw{q}^* \Lie{\el} \w{q} = 0 }.
\ee
In other words,
the whole metric $\w{q}$ (and not only the area form
$\wepsS$, as a mere $\theta_{(\wl)}=0$ would suggest) of any cross-section
$\Sp$ is invariant along the geodesic generators of $\Hor$.
\end{prop}

\begin{example}[Schwarzschild horizon]
We had already noticed that, for the Schwarzschild horizon, $\w{\Theta}=0$
[Eq.~(\ref{e:def:Theta_zero_Schw_hor}) in Example~\ref{x:def:Schw_hor8}
of Chap.~\ref{s:def}].
\end{example}

\subsection{Induced affine connection} \label{e:neh:induced_connection}

Since $\Hor$ is a null hypersurface, the ``metric'' $\left. \w{g}\right|_{\Hor}$
induced on it by the spacetime metric $\w{g}$ is degenerate. As a consequence, there
is a priori no unique connection on $\Hor$ associated with
$\left. \w{g}\right|_{\Hor}$. However, when
$\Hor$ is a non-expanding horizon and the null convergence condition holds on $\Hor$,
so that $\w{\Theta}=0$ (Property~\ref{p:neh:invariance_of_2metric}),
the spacetime connection $\wnab$ induces a unique
torsion-free connection ${}^\Hor\!\wnab$ on $\Hor$ as follows.
Let $\w{u}$ and $\w{v}$ be two vector fields on $\Hor$. We have, using
(\ref{e:def:nab_l_Theta}) to express $\nabla_\nu \el_\mu$ in terms of $\Theta_{\nu\mu}$:
\[
    \el_\mu u^\nu \nabla_\nu v^\mu =
        u^\nu \nabla_\nu ( \underbrace{\el_\mu v^\mu}_{0} )
        - v^\mu u^\nu \nabla_\nu \el_\mu
        =  - \underbrace{\Theta_{\nu\mu}}_{0} v^\mu u^\nu  - \omega_\nu u^\nu
            \underbrace{\el_\mu v^\mu}_{0}
            + v^\mu \underbrace{u^\nu \el_\nu}_{0} k^\sigma\nabla_\sigma \el_\mu
             = 0 .
\]
Hence $\wl$ is orthogonal to the vector field $\wnab_{\w{u}} \w{v}$. It follows
immediately that $\wnab_{\w{u}} \w{v}$ is tangent to $\Hor$.
We conclude:
\begin{prop}[induced affine connection]
Under the hypotheses of Property~\ref{p:neh:invariance_of_2metric},
the operator
\be \label{e:neh:def_induced_connection}
    \begin{array}{cccc}
    {}^\Hor\!\wnab \ : & \mathfrak{X}(\Hor)\times\mathfrak{X}(\Hor) & \longrightarrow & \mathfrak{X}(\Hor) \\
    & (\w{u},\w{v}) & \longmapsto & \wnab_{\w{u}} \,\w{v} ,
    \end{array}
\ee
where $\mathfrak{X}(\Hor)$ stands for the space of vector fields on $\Hor$, is
well-defined (i.e. ${}^\Hor\!\wnab_{\w{u}}\w{v}$  belongs to
$\mathfrak{X}(\Hor)$).
Moreover, this operator fulfills all the properties of an affine connection
(cf. Sec.~\ref{s:bas:affine_connect}), since $\wnab$ does.
We naturally call ${}^\Hor\!\wnab$ the \defin{affine connection induced on $\Hor$
by}\index{induced! affine connection}\index{affine!connection!induced --}\index{connection!induced --} $\wnab$.
\end{prop}

As a consequence of the identity
${}^\Hor\!\wnab_{\w{u}}\w{v} = \wnab_{\w{u}}\w{v}$ for tangent vector fields to $\Hor$,
$(\Hor, {}^\Hor\!\wnab)$ is a \defin{totally geodesic submanifold}\index{totally geodesic}
of $(\M,\w{g})$,
i.e. any geodesic of $(\Hor, {}^\Hor\!\wnab)$ is also a geodesic of $(\M,\w{g})$
(cf. the historical note on p.~\pageref{h:neh:NEH}).

\begin{prop}[horizon-intrinsic derivative of the null normal]
\label{p:neh:Hnab_l}
Under the hypotheses of Property~\ref{p:neh:invariance_of_2metric},
the covariant derivative of the null normal $\wl$ with respect to the affine
connection ${}^\Hor\!\wnab$ takes the form
\be \label{e:neh:nabH_ell}
   \encadre{ {}^\Hor\!\wnab \wl = \wl \otimes {}^\Hor\!\w{\omega} },
\ee
where ${}^\Hor\!\w{\omega}$ is the tensor field on $\Hor$
defined as the restriction of the 1-form $\w{\omega}$
introduced in Sec.~\ref{s:def:deformation_shear}
to tangent vectors to $\Hor$ [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:def:omega_restrict_H})].
In other words, ${}^\Hor\!\w{\omega}$ is the pullback $\iota^*\w{\omega}$ of
$\w{\omega}$ by the inclusion map $\iota: \Hor \to \M$ (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:bas:push_pull}).
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
By definition of the covariant derivative with respect to an
affine connection [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:bas:def_cov_deriv}) in Appendix~\ref{s:bas}],
${}^\Hor\!\wnab \wl$ is a tensor field of type $(1,1)$ on $\Hor$,
the action of which on any pair
$(\w{a}, \w{u})$ formed by a 1-form $\w{a}$ on $\Hor$ and a vector field $\w{u}$
on $\Hor$ is
\[
    {}^\Hor\!\wnab \wl (\w{a}, \w{u}) = \langle \w{a}, {}^\Hor\!\wnab_{\w{u}} \wl \rangle .
\]
Let $\w{\bar{a}}$ be the extension of $\w{a}$ to a 1-form on $\M$ defined by
$\w{\bar{a}} = \w{a} \circ \w{\Pi}$, where $\w{\Pi}$ is the projector onto $\Hor$
along $\w{k}$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:def:def_proj_H_along_k})]. Since ${}^\Hor\!\wnab_{\w{u}} \wl$
is tangent to $\Hor$, we have
$\langle \w{a}, {}^\Hor\!\wnab_{\w{u}} \wl \rangle = \langle \w{\bar{a}}, {}^\Hor\!\wnab_{\w{u}} \wl \rangle$.
In view of (\ref{e:neh:def_induced_connection}) and using Eq.~(\ref{e:def:nab_l_Theta})
to express $\wnab\wl$, we then get
\begin{align}
    {}^\Hor\!\wnab \wl (\w{a}, \w{u}) & = \langle \w{\bar{a}}, \wnab_{\w{u}} \wl \rangle
       = \bar{a}_\mu u^\nu \nabla_\nu \ell^\mu
       = \bar{a}_\mu u^\nu \Big( \underbrace{\Theta^\mu_{\ \, \nu}}_{0} + \omega_\nu \ell^\mu
            - \ell_\nu k^\rho \nabla_\rho \ell^\mu \Big)
        \nonumber \\
        & = \bar{a}_\mu \ell^\mu \, \omega_\nu u^\nu - \underbrace{\ell_\nu u^\nu}_{0}
            \bar{a}_\mu k^\rho \nabla_\rho \ell^\mu
             = \langle \w{\bar{a}}, \wl \rangle \, \langle \w{\omega}, \w{u} \rangle
             = \langle \w{a}, \wl \rangle \, \langle {}^\Hor\!\w{\omega}, \w{u} \rangle . \nonumber
\end{align}
Given the definition of a tensor product,
this proves Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:nabH_ell}).
\end{proof}
A priori the 1-form ${}^\Hor\!\w{\omega}$ depends upon the choice of the cross-section $\Sp$
of $\Hor$, via the vector $\w{k}$ involved in Eq.~(\ref{e:def:omega_restrict_H}):
$\langle {}^\Hor\!\w{\omega}, \w{v} \rangle = - \w{k} \cdot\wnab_{\w{v}} \w{\ell}$
for any $\w{v}\in T_p\Hor$. Formula~(\ref{e:neh:nabH_ell}) shows that for a non-expanding
horizon, this is not the case: ${}^\Hor\!\w{\omega}$ is  a quantity intrinsic to $\Hor$ and to the value of $\wl$ on $\Hor$.
Moreover, under a change of null normal, $\wl \mapsto \wl' = \alpha \wl$,
it remains constant up to the addition of an exact 1-form:
${}^\Hor\!\w{\omega}' = {}^\Hor\!\w{\omega} + \dd\ln\alpha$.
The 1-form ${}^\Hor\!\w{\omega}$
is usually called the \defin{connection 1-form}\index{connection!1-form}
or \defin{rotation 1-form}\index{rotation!1-form}
of $(\Hor, \wl)$ \cite{AshteBL02,GourgJ06}; the term \emph{rotation}
stems from the angular momentum of the non-expanding horizon
being given by an integral involving ${}^\Hor\!\w{\omega}$, as we shall see
in Chap.~\ref{s:loc}.

about non-expanding horizons, in particular for a subclass of them
called \emph{isolated horizons}\index{isolated!horizon}\index{horizon!isolated}.

\section{Killing horizons} \label{s:neh:Killing_hor}

A special kind of non-expanding horizons, which is of primordial
importance for the theory of
stationary black holes, is that of Killing horizons with closed-manifold cross-sections.
Defining a Killing horizon requires the concepts of \emph{1-dimensional group of
isometries} and \emph{Killing vector}, which we discuss first.

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{def_group_action.pdf}}
\caption[]{\label{f:neh:group_action} \footnotesize
Group action of $G$ on $\M$.}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Spacetime symmetries} \label{s:neh:symmetries}

Symmetries of spacetime, such as stationarity and axisymmetry,
are described in a coordinate-independent way by means of
a group acting on the spacetime manifold $\M$.
Through this action, each element of the group displaces points within $\M$ and one demands that the metric $\w{g}$ is invariant under such displacement.
More precisely, given
a group $G$, a \defin{group action}\index{group!action} of $G$ on $\M$ is a map\footnote{Do no confuse the generic element $g$ of group $G$ with the metric tensor $\w{g}$.}
\be
    \begin{array}{rccl}
    \Phi: & G\times \M & \longrightarrow & \M \\
        & (g,p) & \longmapsto & \Phi(g,p) =: \Phi_g(p)
    \end{array}
\ee
such that (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:neh:group_action})
\begin{itemize}
\item $\forall p\in \M,\  \Phi_e(p) = p$, where $e$ is the identity element of $G$;
\item $\forall (g,h) \in G^2,\  \forall p\in\M,\  \Phi_g(\Phi_h(p)) = \Phi_{gh}(p)$, where $gh$ stands for the product of $g$ by $h$ according to $G$'s group law.
\end{itemize}
The \defin{orbit}\index{orbit!under a group action} of a point $p\in\M$ is the set $\{g(p),\ g\in G\}\subset\M$, i.e. the set of points which are connected to $p$ by some transformation belonging to $G$. One says that $p$ is a
\defin{fixed point}\index{fixed point} of the group action if its orbit is
reduced to $\{p\}$.

An important class of group actions are those for which $G$ is a 1-dimensional
\emph{Lie group}, i.e. a so-called ``continuous group'' (actually a \emph{differentiable} group).
Then around $e$, the elements of $G$ can be labelled by a parameter $t\in \R$, such that $g_{t=0} = e$. It is then
common to use the shorthand notation
\be
        \Phi_t := \Phi_{g_t} .
\ee
If $G$ is a 1-dimensional Lie group, the orbit of a given point $p\in\M$ under the group action is then either $\{p\}$ (when $p$ is a fixed point of the
group action) or a curve $\Li_p$ of $\M$. In the latter case,
$t$ is a natural parameter along $\Li_p$ (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:neh:orbit_group}). The tangent vector $\w{\xi}$ to $\Li_p$
corresponding to that parameter is called the \defin{generator of the group} $G$
associated with the $t$-parametrization of $G$. At each point of
the orbit $\Li_p$, it is given by
(cf. Sec.~\ref{s:bas:vectors} and Fig.~\ref{f:neh:orbit_group})
\be \label{e:neh:xi_dxdt}
    \w{\xi} = \left. \frac{\D\w{x}}{\D t} \right|_{\Li_p} .
\ee
We can extend $\w{\xi}$ to a vector field on all $\M$, by varying $p$
over $\M$ and setting $\w{\xi} = 0$ if $p$ is a fixed point
of the group action.
For any $p\in\M$ and $\D t$ infinitesimal, the (infinitesimal)
vector connecting $p$ to $\Phi_{\D t}(p)$ is then $\D\w{x} = \D t \, \w{\xi}$
(cf. Fig.~\ref{f:neh:orbit_group}), so that we may state:
\begin{prop}[infinitesimal transformations as displacements along the generator]
A 1-dimensional group action limited to infinitesimal transformations of parameter
$\D t$ around the identity ($\D t =0$) amounts to displacements by the infinitesimal vector $\D t\, \w{\xi}$, where $\w{\xi}$ is the generator of the group.
\end{prop}

\end{figure}

Given a spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$ and a 1-dimensional Lie group $G$, one
says that $G$ is a
\defin{symmetry group}\index{symmetry!group}\index{group!symmetry --}
or a \defin{isometry group}\index{isometry!group}\index{group!isometry --}
of $(\M,\w{g})$, or equivalently that
$(\M,\w{g})$ is
\defin{invariant under the action of}\index{invariance!under a group action} $G$,
iff there is an action $\Phi$ of $G$ on $\M$
such that for any value of the parameter $t$ of $G$,
$\Phi_t$ is an \defin{isometry}\index{isometry} of $(\M,\w{g})$, i.e. $\Phi_t$
preserves the ``scalar products'' (and hence the ``distances'')
in the following sense: for any $p\in\M$ and any pair of points $(q,r)$
infinitely close to $p$, one has
\be \label{e:neh:isometry_dx}
    \left.\w{g}\right| _{\Phi_t(p)}(\D\w{x}', \D\w{y}') =
        \left.\w{g}\right| _{p}(\D\w{x}, \D\w{y}) ,
\ee
for the infinitesimal displacement vectors $\D\w{x} := \vp{pq}$, $\D\w{y} := \vp{pr}$,
$\D\w{x}' := \vp{\Phi_t(p)\Phi_t(q)}$ and $\D\w{y}' := \vp{\Phi_t(p)\Phi_t(r)}$
(cf. Sec.~\ref{s:fra:spacetime}).
Now, by definition, $\D\w{x}'$ is nothing but the pushforward\index{pushforward}
of the vector $\D\w{x}\in T_p\M$ to the tangent space
$T_{\Phi_t(p)}\M$ by the map $\Phi_t$
(cf. Sec.~\ref{s:bas:push_pull}),
and similarly $\D\w{y}'$ is the pushforward of $\D\w{y}$ by $\Phi_t$:
\[
    \D\w{x}' = \Phi_{t*}(\D\w{x}) \quad\mbox{and}\quad
    \D\w{y}' = \Phi_{t*}(\D\w{y}) .
\]
By rescaling by infinitely small parameters (using the bilinearity of $\w{g}$),
it is clear that (\ref{e:neh:isometry_dx})
holds for finite vectors as well, so that we may say that $\Phi_t$ is an
isometry of $(\M,\w{g})$ iff
\be \label{e:neh:isometry}
    \forall p\in\M,\  \forall (\w{u},\w{v}) \in (T_p\M)^2,\quad
    \left. \w{g}\right| _{\Phi_t(p)} \left(\Phi_{t*}\w{u}, \Phi_{t*}\w{v}\right) =
    \left. \w{g}\right| _{p} (\w{u},\w{v}) ,
\ee
where $\Phi_{t*} \w{u}$ (resp. $\Phi_{t*} \w{v}$) is the pushforward of the vector
$\w{u}\in T_p\M$ (resp. $\w{v}\in T_p\M$)
to the tangent space $T_{\Phi_t(p)}\M$ by $\Phi_t$ (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:bas:push_pull}).
Given the definition (\ref{e:bas:def_pullback}) of the pullback\index{pullback} of
a multilinear form, we may reexpress the isometry condition (\ref{e:neh:isometry})
in terms of the
pullback of $\w{g}$ by $\Phi_t$:
\be \label{e:neh:isometry_pullback}
    \Phi_t^*\w{g} = \w{g} .
\ee
This is equivalent to the vanishing of the Lie derivative
of $\w{g}$ along the generators of $G$:

\begin{prop}[characterization of continuous spacetime isometries]
\label{p:def_Killing_vector}
A 1-dimensional Lie group $G$
is a symmetry group of the spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$ iff the Lie derivative
of the metric tensor along a generator $\w{\xi}$ of $G$
vanishes identically:
\be \label{e:neh:Lie_xi_g}
    \encadre{\Lie{\xi}\w{g} = 0 } .
\ee
The vector field $\w{\xi}$ is then called a \defin{Killing vector}\index{Killing!vector}
of $(\M,\w{g})$, Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:Lie_xi_g}) being equivalent to the
so-called
\defin{Killing equation}\index{Killing!equation}:
\be \label{e:neh:Killing_equation}
    \encadre{ \nabla_\alpha \xi_\beta + \nabla_\beta \xi_\alpha = 0 }.
\ee
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
According the definition (\ref{e:bas:def_Lie_der_covar}) of the Lie
derivative\index{Lie!derivative}, we have
\[
    \Lie{\xi} \w{g} := \lim_{t \rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{t}
    \left( \Phi_t^*\w{g} - \w{g} \right) .
\]
The isometry condition
(\ref{e:neh:isometry_pullback}) implies then
$\Lie{\xi}\w{g} = 0$. The reverse is true by integration.
The equivalence between Eqs.~(\ref{e:neh:Lie_xi_g})
and (\ref{e:neh:Killing_equation}) immediately results from
expression~(\ref{e:bas:Lie_g_Killing}) for the Lie derivative of
$\w{g}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}[isometry in adapted coordinates]
\label{p:neh:isometry_adapt_coord}
In terms of the components $g_{\alpha\beta}$ of $\w{g}$ with respect to
coordinates $(x^\alpha) = (t,x^1,\ldots,x^{n-1})$ adapted to the Killing vector $\w{\xi}$,
i.e. such that $\w{\xi} = \wpar_t$, the isometry condition (\ref{e:neh:Lie_xi_g})
is equivalent to
\be \label{e:neh:dgabdt_zero}
    \der{g_{\alpha\beta}}{t} = 0 .
\ee
$t$ is then called an \defin{ignorable coordinate}\index{ignorable coordinate}\index{coordinate!ignorable --}.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
This is a direct consequence of the identity (\ref{e:bas:Lie_adapted}).
\end{proof}


\subsection{Definition and examples of Killing horizons} \label{s:neh:def_Killing_hor}

\begin{greybox}
A \defin{Killing horizon}\index{Killing!horizon}\index{horizon!Killing --} is
a connected null hypersurface $\Hor$ in a spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$ admitting a
Killing vector field $\w{\xi}$ such that, on $\Hor$, $\w{\xi}$ is
normal to $\Hor$.
\end{greybox}

Thus the existence of a Killing horizon requires that the spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$ has
some continuous symmetry
(usually stationarity), namely that it is invariant under the action of a
1-parameter group, as described in Sec.~\ref{s:neh:symmetries}.
Since the normal to a null hypersurface is tangent to its null geodesic
generators and a Killing vector is tangent to the orbits of the isometry group,
a definition equivalent to the above one is:
\begin{greybox}
A \defin{Killing horizon} is a connected null
hypersurface $\Hor$ whose null geodesic generators are orbits of a
1-parameter group of isometries of $(\M,\w{g})$.
\end{greybox}

Its immediately follows from the definition that the Killing vector $\w{\xi}$ is non-vanishing
on $\Hor$ (a normal to a hypersurface cannot vanish) and is null on $\Hor$:
\be \label{s:neh:xi_on_KH}
    \left. \w{\xi} \right| _{\Hor} \not= 0
    \qquad\mbox{and}\qquad
    \left. \w{\xi}\cdot\w{\xi} \right| _{\Hor} = 0 .
\ee

We shall see in Chap.~\ref{s:sta} that in a stationary spacetime, under some rather generic
hypotheses, a (connected part of a) black hole
event horizon must be a Killing horizon.

$\Hor$, while the thick black line (actually a 2-plane) marks the location
where $\w{\xi}$ vanishes.}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}[null hyperplane as a translation-Killing horizon]
\label{x:neh:transKH}
Let us consider the null hyperplane of Minkowski spacetime $\Hor$ discussed in
Examples~\ref{x:def:null_hyp}, \ref{x:def:null_hyp2} and \ref{x:def:null_hyp3}
of Chap.~\ref{s:def}.
$\Hor$ is defined by the equation $t=x$. The vector field
\be
    \w{\xi} := \wpar_t + \wpar_x
\ee
is a Killing vector of Minkowski spacetime: $\w{\xi}$ is the generator of
translations in the direction $\wpar_t + \wpar_x$, and these translations constitute a
1-dimensional subgroup of the Poincaré group --- the symmetry group of Minkowski
spacetime. We note that $\w{\xi}$ coincides with the null vector $\wl$
defined by Eq.~(\ref{e:def:wl_null_hyperplane}). Since $\wl$ is
normal to $\Hor$, we conclude immediately that $\Hor$ is a Killing horizon
with respect to $\w{\xi}$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[null hyperplane as a boost-Killing horizon]
\label{x:neh:boostKH}
Let us consider the same null hyperplane $\Hor$ as above, but
with another Killing vector of Minkowski spacetime:
\be \label{e:neh:boost-Killing}
    \w{\xi} := x \wpar_t + t \wpar_x .
\ee
This vector is the
generator of the 1-parameter group of Lorentz boosts\index{boost} in the $(t,x)$ plane.
On $\Hor$ we have (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:neh:hplaneKilling-boost}):
\[
    \w{\xi} \equalH t (\wpar_t + \wpar_x) \equalH t \, \wl ,
\]
where $\wl$ is the null normal to $\Hor$ defined by
Eq.~(\ref{e:def:wl_null_hyperplane}) and the notation $\equalH$ means that the equality holds only on $\Hor$. We conclude that $\w{\xi}$ is a normal to
the null hypersurface $\Hor$ as soon as $t\not=0$. Therefore, we may split
$\Hor\setminus\{t=0\}$ in two open half-hyperplanes:
\be \label{e:neh:boost-Killing_hor}
    \Hor^+ := \{ p\in\Hor,\quad t(p) > 0 \} \quad\mbox{and}\quad
    \Hor^- := \{ p\in\Hor,\quad t(p) < 0 \} ,
\ee
so that each of them is a Killing horizon with
respect to $\w{\xi}$ (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:neh:hplaneKilling-boost}).
\end{example}

\begin{example}[null hyperplane as a null-rotation-Killing horizon]
\label{x:neh:nullrotKH}
Another example of Killing horizon is still provided by the null hyperplane
$\Hor$ considered above, but this time with the Killing vector
\be \label{e:neh:xi_null_rotation}
   \w{\xi} := y( \wpar_t + \wpar_x ) + (t-x)\wpar_y .
\ee
This vector is indeed the generator of
null rotations leaving the plane
$\mathrm{Span}(\wl,\wpar_z)$ strictly invariant (cf. e.g. Sec.~6.4.5 of
Ref.~\cite{Gourg13}), $\wl$ being the null normal of $\Hor$ defined by
Eq.~(\ref{e:def:wl_null_hyperplane}). These null rotations form a
1-dimensional subgroup of the Lorentz group, and thereby
a symmetry group of Minkowski spacetime. It is also immediate to check that
the vector defined by (\ref{e:neh:xi_null_rotation}) obeys
Killing equation (\ref{e:neh:Killing_equation}).
On $\Hor$, $t-x=0$, so that
(\ref{e:neh:xi_null_rotation}) reduces to
\[
    \w{\xi}  \equalH y ( \wpar_t + \wpar_x )  \equalH y \, \wl .
\]
It follows that $\w{\xi}$ is a null normal to $\Hor$ as soon as $y\not=0$.
We may then split $\Hor\setminus\{y=0\}$ in two open half-hyperplanes:
\[
    \Hor_1 := \{ p\in\Hor,\quad y(p) < 0 \} \quad\mbox{and}\quad
    \Hor_2 := \{ p\in\Hor,\quad y(p) > 0 \} ,
\]
each of them being a Killing horizon with
respect to $\w{\xi}$ (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:neh:hplaneKilling-nullrot}).
\end{example}

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{def_hplaneKilling-nullrot.pdf}}
\caption[]{\label{f:neh:hplaneKilling-nullrot} \footnotesize

$\Hor$, while the thick black line (actually a 2-plane) marks the location
where $\w{\xi}$ vanishes.}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}[light cone as a counter-example]
The future light cone introduced in Example~\ref{x:def:light_cone} of Chap.~\ref{s:def} is \emph{not} a
Killing horizon of Minkowski spacetime: it is invariant under the action
of the Lorentz group, but its null generators are not invariant
under the action of a single 1-dimensional subgroup of the Lorentz group.
Actually the future light cone is an example of a more general structure,
which Carter has termed a
\defin{local isometry horizon}\index{local isometry horizon}\index{isometry!horizon}\index{horizon!local isometry --} \cite{Carte67,Carte69}: a null hypersurface that is invariant under
some group $G$ of isometries (here: the Lorentz group) and such that each null
geodesic generator is an orbit of some 1-dimensional subgroup of $G$,
this subgroup being not necessarily the same from one null generator to the next
(here: using Minkowskian spherical
coordinates $(t,r,\th,\ph)$,
the null geodesic generator through the point of coordinates $(1,1,\th_0,\ph_0)$
is the orbit of this point under the subgroup of boosts in the plane
$(\th,\ph) = (\th_0,\ph_0)$). A Killing horizon is a local isometry horizon
for which $\dim G = 1$.
\end{example}


\begin{example}[Schwarzschild horizon] \label{x:neh:Schwarz_KH}
Given the expression (\ref{e:def:wl_Schw_hor}) for the null normal $\wl$
of the family of hypersurfaces $\Hor_u$ and the fact that the Schwarzschild
horizon $\Hor$ is defined by $r=2m$, we have
\be \label{e:neh:wl_wpt_Schw_hor}
    \wl \equalH \wpar_t .
\ee
Now the vector field $\wpar_t$ is clearly a Killing vector of metric $\w{g}$
as given by (\ref{e:def:Schw_metric}), since none of the metric components
$g_{\alpha\beta}$ depends upon $t$. Hence (\ref{e:neh:wl_wpt_Schw_hor})
shows that the Schwarzschild horizon is a Killing horizon. By the way,
Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:wl_wpt_Schw_hor}) was our motivation for the choice of the
null normal $\wl$ performed in Example~\ref{x:def:Schw_hor2} of Chap.~\ref{s:def}.
\end{example}

\begin{hist}
The concept of Killing horizon has been introduced by Brandon Carter\index[pers]{Carter, B.} in
1966 \cite{Carte66,Carte67} and developed in an article published in
1969 \cite{Carte69}. The properties of Killing horizons have been
studied in detail by Robert H. Boyer\index[pers]{Boyer, R.H.},
in an article prepared posthumously from his notes
by J.~Ehlers and J.L.~Stachel and published in 1969 \cite{Boyer69},
leading to the concept of \emph{bifurcate Killing horizon}, to be discussed in
Sec.~\ref{s:sta:bifur_Killing_hor} (cf. the historical note on p.~\pageref{h:sta:Boyer}).
\end{hist}

\subsection{Killing horizons as non-expanding horizons}

Let us consider a cross-section $\Sp$ of a Killing horizon $\Hor$ with respect to a Killing vector $\w{\xi}$
and let us select the null normal $\wl$ to coincide with $\w{\xi}$ on $\Hor$:
$\wl \equalH \w{\xi}$. Since $\w{\xi}$ is an isometry generator, it is pretty obvious that the
metric $\w{q}$ induced by $\w{g}$ on $\Sp$ will not evolve when Lie dragged along $\w{\xi}$ and
hence that the deformation rate $\w{\Theta}$ of $\Sp$ along $\w{\xi}$, as defined by
Eq.~(\ref{e:def:Theta}), vanishes identically.
One can establish this rigorously from expression~(\ref{e:def:Theta_q_nabla_l}) for $\w{\Theta}$.
Indeed, without any loss of generality, we may express
the null vector field $\wl$ in a neighborhood of $\Hor$ as $\wl = \w{\xi} + u \w{w}$ where $u$ is a scalar field
defining $\Hor$ as the level set $u=0$, i.e. a scalar field obeying Eqs.~(\ref{e:def:Hor_u_zero})-(\ref{e:def:du_not_zero}). Then Eq.~(\ref{e:def:Theta_q_nabla_l}) leads to
\[
    \Theta_{\alpha\beta}  = q^\mu_{\ \, \alpha} q^\nu_{\ \, \beta} \nabla_\mu \xi_\nu
        + \underbrace{u}_{0} q^\mu_{\ \, \alpha} q^\nu_{\ \, \beta} \nabla_\mu w_\nu
        + \underbrace{q^\mu_{\ \, \alpha} \nabla_\mu u}_{0} \; q^\nu_{\ \, \beta}  w_\nu
        = q^\mu_{\ \, \alpha} q^\nu_{\ \, \beta} \nabla_\mu \xi_\nu ,
\]
where the identifications with zero hold on $\Sp$, the second one because $u$ is constant (being equal to zero) on
$\Sp$. Now thanks to the Killing equation (\ref{e:neh:Killing_equation}), $q^\mu_{\ \, \alpha} q^\nu_{\ \, \beta} \nabla_\mu \xi_\nu$ is an antisymmetric tensor field, while $\Theta_{\alpha\beta}$ is symmetric
(cf. Sec.~\ref{s:def:deformation_shear}). It follows that $\Theta_{\alpha\beta}=0$.
In view of the scaling law (\ref{e:def:rescale_deform_shear}), we can extend this result to the deformation rate
of $\Sp$ along any null normal to $\Hor$ and therefore state:

\begin{prop}[vanishing of the deformation rate of cross-sections of a Killing horizon]
On a Killing horizon $\Hor$,
the deformation rate $\w{\Theta}$ of any cross-section along any null normal $\wl$
is identically zero:
\be \label{e:neh:Theta_zero_KillingH}
   \encadre{ \w{\Theta} = 0 }.
\ee
This implies that the expansion of $\Hor$ along any null normal $\wl$ vanishes:
\be
    \theta_{(\wl)} = 0 .
\ee
\end{prop}
In view of the definition of a non-expanding horizon (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:neh:def}),
an immediate corollary is
\begin{prop}[Killing horizons as non-expanding horizons]
Any Killing horizon with closed-manifold cross-sections is a non-expanding horizon.
\end{prop}

\begin{remark}
$\w{\Theta}$ vanishes for any Killing horizon [Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:Theta_zero_KillingH})], while to get the same result on a generic non-expanding horizon, one has to assume that the null convergence condition holds on $\Hor$
(Property~\ref{p:neh:invariance_of_2metric}).
\end{remark}

\subsection{Expressions of the non-affinity coefficient}

Let $\kappa$ be the non-affinity coefficient
(cf. Sec.~\ref{s:def:geod_gener} and \ref{s:geo:gener_param})
of the null normal $\wl$ coinciding with the Killing vector $\w{\xi}$
on a Killing horizon $\Hor$. According to the definition
(\ref{e:def:wl_geod_kappa}), we have
\be \label{e:neh:xi_nab_xi_kappa}
    \wnab_{\w{\xi}}\, \w{\xi} \equalH \kappa \, \w{\xi} .
\ee
Let us consider the metric dual of this relation, i.e.
$\xi^\mu \nabla_\mu \xi_\alpha \equalH \kappa \, \xi_\alpha$,
and use the Killing equation (\ref{e:neh:Killing_equation}) as
$\nabla_\mu \xi_\alpha = - \nabla_\alpha \xi_\mu$; we get
\[
    \xi^\mu \nabla_\alpha \xi_\mu \equalH - \kappa \, \xi_\alpha .
\]
Now $\xi^\mu \nabla_\alpha \xi_\mu = 1/2 \, \nabla_\alpha (\xi_\mu \xi^\mu)$.
Hence
\be
    \nabla_\alpha (\xi_\mu \xi^\mu) \equalH - 2 \kappa \, \xi_\alpha.
\ee
Since $\xi_\mu \xi^\mu = \w{\xi}\cdot\w{\xi}$ is a scalar field, we may
replace the covariant derivative by the differential:
\be \label{e:neh:dxi2_kappa}
    \encadre{ \dd (\w{\xi}\cdot\w{\xi}) \equalH - 2 \kappa \, \uu{\xi} } .
\ee

\begin{remark}
If $u:=\w{\xi}\cdot\w{\xi}$ is a regular scalar field in the vicinity of $\Hor$, in the sense
that $\dd u \neq 0$, it is not surprising to have $\dd u$ proportional
to $\uu{\xi}$ on $\Hor$. Indeed, if $\dd u \neq 0$, the hypersurface $\Hor$ can be considered
as the level set $u=0$ for $\w{\xi}$ is null on $\Hor$ (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:def:hypsurf_level}).
It follows that the gradient $\vw{\nabla} u$ must be collinear to
the normal $\w{\xi}$ to $\Hor$ (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:def:null_normal}) or equivalently
$\dd u \equalH \alpha\, \uu{\xi}$. Equation~(\ref{e:neh:dxi2_kappa}) simply shows
that the proportionality factor is $\alpha = -2\kappa$.
\end{remark}

Another interesting relation is obtained from the Frobenius theorem\index{Frobenius!theorem}
applied to $\w{\xi}$. Indeed, since on $\Hor$, $\w{\xi}$ is normal to a hypersurface
($\Hor$), the Frobenius theorem in its dual formulation
(see e.g.
Theorem B.3.2 in Wald's textbook \cite{Wald84} or Theorem C.2 in
Straumann's textbook \cite{Strau13}) states that there exists a 1-form
$\w{a}$ such that
\be
    \dd \uu{\xi} \equalH \w{a} \wedge \uu{\xi} ,
\ee
or equivalently
\be \label{e:neh:Frobenius_xi}
  \nabla_\alpha \xi_\beta - \nabla_\beta \xi_\alpha \equalH
  a_\alpha \, \xi_\beta -  a_\beta  \, \xi_\alpha  .
\ee

\begin{remark}
In the case of the vector $\wl$, which is normal to $\Hor$ by definition,
the Frobenius identity is
Eq.~(\ref{e:def:ext_der_wl_comp}): $\nabla_\alpha \el_\beta - \nabla_\beta \el_\alpha =
  \nabla_\alpha \rho \, \el_\beta -  \nabla_\beta \rho \, \el_\alpha$.
Since $\wl \equalH \w{\xi}$, we may write
\[
  \nabla_\alpha \el_\beta - \nabla_\beta \el_\alpha \equalH
  \nabla_\alpha \rho \, \xi_\beta -  \nabla_\beta \rho \, \xi_\alpha .
\]
But in general,  $\nabla_\alpha \el_\beta \not= \nabla_\alpha \xi_\beta$ on $\Hor$,
since $\wl$ and $\w{\xi}$ do not coincide outside $\Hor$. Accordingly, one
cannot identify the left-hand side of the above equation with the left-hand side
of Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:Frobenius_xi}), so that the 1-form $\w{a}$ is \emph{not} $\wnab\rho$.
\end{remark}

Thanks to the Killing equation (\ref{e:neh:Killing_equation}), we may reshape
(\ref{e:neh:Frobenius_xi}) to
\be \label{e:neh:Frobenius_xi_Killing}
    2 \nabla_\alpha \xi_\beta \equalH
  a_\alpha \, \xi_\beta -  a_\beta \, \xi_\alpha  .
\ee
Contracting this relation with $\w{\xi}$, we get
\[
   2 \xi^\mu \nabla_\mu \xi_\alpha \equalH a_\mu \xi^\mu  \, \xi_\alpha
    -  \underbrace{\xi_\mu \xi^\mu}_{\equalH 0} \, a_\alpha .
\]
In view of Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:xi_nab_xi_kappa}), the left-hand side of this
equation is $2\kappa \xi_\alpha$. Hence we obtain
\be \label{e:neh:a_xi_2_kappa}
    a_\mu \xi^\mu \equalH 2 \kappa .
\ee
Besides, taking the square of (\ref{e:neh:Frobenius_xi_Killing}) leads to
\bea
    4 \nabla_\mu \xi_\nu \, \nabla^\mu \xi^\nu & \equalH &
        \left( a_\mu \xi_\nu -  a_\nu \xi_\mu \right)
       \left( a^\mu \xi^\nu - a^\nu \xi^\mu \right)
       \nonumber \\
       & \equalH & a_\mu a^\mu
        \underbrace{ \xi_\nu \xi^\nu}_{\equalH 0}
        - \underbrace{a_\mu \xi^\mu}_{2\kappa}
         \underbrace{a_\nu \xi^\nu}_{2\kappa}
        - \underbrace{a_\nu \xi^\nu}_{2\kappa}
            \underbrace{a_\mu \xi^\mu}_{2\kappa}
        + a_\nu  a^\nu
        \underbrace{ \xi_\mu \xi^\mu}_{\equalH 0}
        \equalH  - 8 \kappa^2 , \nonumber
\eea
where we have used Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:a_xi_2_kappa}).
Hence
\be \label{e:neh:kappa2}
    \encadre{\kappa^2 \equalH - \frac{1}{2}
        \nabla_\mu \xi_\nu \nabla^\mu \xi^\nu } .
\ee
This is an explicit expression of $\kappa$ in terms of the Killing vector
field $\w{\xi}$.
However, in actual calculations, it is generally preferable to employ
formula~(\ref{e:neh:dxi2_kappa}) to evaluate $\kappa$, because it does not involve
the computation of any covariant derivative, contrary to formula~(\ref{e:neh:kappa2}).


\subsection{The zeroth law of black hole dynamics} \label{s:neh:zeroth_law}

We are going to derive a result of great importance for black hole physics,
namely the non-affinity coefficient $\kappa$ discussed above
is constant on a Killing horizon, provided some mild energy condition holds.

Let us denote by $\wl$ the null normal to $\Hor$ that coincides with
the Killing vector field: $\wl \equalH \w{\xi}$. The vector field
$\wl$ is then a symmetry generator on $\Hor$, which implies
\be \label{e:neh:kappa_const_along_L}
    \Lie{\el} \kappa = 0 .
\ee
This means that $\kappa$ is constant along any field line of $\wl$ (i.e. any
null geodesic generator of $\Hor$). It could however vary from one field line to another.
To prove that this is not the case, let us consider a complete cross-section
$\Sp$ of $\Hor$ and show that $\kappa$ is constant on $\Sp$. The starting
point is applying the 1-form identity (\ref{e:def:contract_Ricci_ident}) to a generic vector field $\w{v}$ tangent to $\Sp$,
i.e. contract (\ref{e:def:contract_Ricci_ident}) with $v^\alpha$. Since $\el_\mu v^\mu = 0$, we get
\be \label{e:def:0law_prov}
    v^\nu \nabla_\mu \Theta^\mu_{\ \, \nu}  + v^\nu \el^\mu \nabla_\mu \omega_\nu
       - v^\mu \nabla_\mu \left( \theta_{(\wl)} + \kappa \right)
        + \left( \theta_{(\wl)} + \kappa \right) \omega_\mu v^\mu
        - \Theta_{\mu\nu} v^\mu k^\sigma \nabla_\sigma \el^\nu
     = R_{\mu\nu} \el^\mu v^\nu .
\ee
Now, since $\Hor$ is a Killing horizon, we have $\w{\Theta}=0$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:Theta_zero_KillingH})] and in particular
$\theta_{(\wl)} =0$, so that many terms in the above equation vanish.
The term $\nabla_\mu \Theta^\mu_{\ \, \nu}$ requires some special care though, because it potentially
involves derivatives of $\vw{\Theta}$ in directions transverse\footnote{Recall that, in our setting, tensor fields are extended beyond $\Hor$ by considering $\Hor$ as the element $u=0$ of a
family $(\Hor_u)_{u\in\R}$ of null hypersurfaces (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:def:null_normal}). We cannot assume
that each $\Hor_u$ is a Killing horizon (because typically the scalar $\w{\xi}\cdot\w{\xi}$ vanishes on
a single hypersurface, not on an open subset of $\M$), so
$\vw{\Theta}$ is a priori not zero outside $\Hor$.}
 to $\Hor$. Let us then introduce
in the vicinity of $\Sp$ a spacetime coordinate system $(x^\alpha) = (u,v,x^2,\ldots,x^{n-1})$
adapted to $\Sp$, as the one introduced in Sec.~\ref{s:def:def_expansion}
[cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:def:l_wpar_v})], namely a coordinate system such that $\Sp$
is the set $(u,v) = (0,0)$. Then the components of $\vw{\Theta}$ with respect
to $(x^\alpha)$ necessarily verify $\Theta^0_{\ \, \alpha} = 0$ and
$\Theta^1_{\ \, \alpha} = 0$. Indeed, since $\vw{\Theta}$ is a tensor field
tangent to $\Sp$, on which $u$ and $v$ are constant,
we have $\Theta^\mu_{\ \, \alpha} \nabla_\mu u = 0$ and
$\Theta^\mu_{\ \, \alpha} \nabla_\mu v= 0$ with $\nabla_\mu u = \partial_\mu u = \delta^0_{\ \, \mu}$
and $\nabla_\mu v = \partial_\mu v = \delta^1_{\ \, \mu}$ by definition of $(x^\alpha)$.
Expressing the covariant derivative via Eq.~(\ref{e:bas:der_cov_coord}), we get
\[
    \nabla_\mu \Theta^\mu_{\ \, \nu} = \partial_a \Theta^a_{\ \, \nu}
        + \Gamma^\mu_{\ \, \mu\sigma} \Theta^\sigma_{\ \, \nu}
        - \Gamma^\sigma_{\ \, \mu\nu}  \Theta^\mu_{\ \, \sigma} ,
\]
where the sum of the partial derivatives has been limited to the indices
$a\in\{2,\ldots,n-1\}$ since $\Theta^0_{\ \, \nu} = \Theta^1_{\ \, \nu} = 0$.
Given that the term $\partial_a \Theta^a_{\ \, \nu}$ involves only the variation
of $\vw{\Theta}$ in directions tangent to $\Sp$, we conclude that
$\nabla_\mu \Theta^\mu_{\ \, \nu} = 0$ if $\vw{\Theta} = 0$ on $\Sp$.
Hence, for a Killing horizon,
Eq.~(\ref{e:def:0law_prov}) reduces to
\be \label{e:neh:zeroth_law_step1}
  (\el^\nu \nabla_\nu \omega_\mu + \kappa  \, \omega_\mu) v^\mu
    - v^\mu \nabla_\mu \kappa
    = R_{\mu\nu} \el^\mu v^\nu .
\ee
The terms in the parentheses are related to the Lie derivative
of $\w{\omega}$ along $\wl$; indeed formula (\ref{e:bas:Lie_der_comp_nab}) gives:
\bea
    \Liec{\el}\omega_\mu & =  & \el^\nu \nabla_\nu \omega_\mu + \omega_\nu \nabla_\mu \el^\nu
     = \el^\nu \nabla_\nu \omega_\mu + \omega_\nu \left( \Theta_\mu^{\ \, \nu}
     + \omega_\mu \el^\nu - \el_\mu k^\sigma \nabla_\sigma \el^\nu \right) \nonumber \\
     & = & \el^\nu \nabla_\nu \omega_\mu  + \kappa \omega_\mu - \omega_\nu \el_\mu k^\sigma \nabla_\sigma \el^\nu , \nonumber
\eea
where we have expressed $\nabla_\mu \el^\nu$ via Eq.~(\ref{e:def:nab_l_Theta}) and
have used $\Theta_\mu^{\ \, \nu} = 0$ and $\omega_\nu \el^\nu = \kappa$
[Eq.~(\ref{e:def:omega_l_kappa})].
Given that $\el_\mu v^\mu = 0$, Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:zeroth_law_step1})
becomes
\be  \label{e:neh:zeroth_law_step2}
  \langle \Lie{\el} \w{\omega}, \w{v} \rangle - \wnab_{\w{v}}\,  \kappa
    = \w{R}(\wl, \w{v}) .
\ee
It is judicious to
express $\Lie{\el}\w{\omega}$ in terms of $\Lie{\el}{}^{\Hor}\!\w{\omega}$,
where ${}^{\Hor}\!\w{\omega}$ is the restriction of $\w{\omega}$ to tangent vectors
to $\Hor$ (pullback to $\Hor$) introduced in Sec.~\ref{e:neh:induced_connection}.
The reason is that, contrary to $\w{\omega}$,
${}^{\Hor}\!\w{\omega}$ is a geometric quantity intrinsic to
$\Hor$ and $\wl$, independent of $\w{k}$ and hence of the cross-section $\Sp$
(cf. Property~\ref{p:neh:Hnab_l} and the discussion below it).
It has therefore to obey the spacetime symmetry generated by $\w{\xi} \equalH \wl$,
i.e. one has
\be \label{e:neh:Lie_l_Homeg_zero}
    \Lie{\el} {}^{\Hor}\!\w{\omega} = 0 .
\ee
Now, using the Leibniz rule twice, we get
\[
    \langle \Lie{\el} \w{\omega}, \w{v} \rangle = \Lie{\el}
    \underbrace{\langle \w{\omega}, \w{v} \rangle}_{\langle {}^{\Hor}\!\w{\omega}, \w{v} \rangle}
    - \underbrace{\langle \w{\omega}, \Lie{\el} \w{v} \rangle}_{\langle {}^{\Hor}\!\w{\omega}, \Lie{\el} \w{v} \rangle} = \langle \Lie{\el} {}^{\Hor}\!\w{\omega}, \w{v} \rangle ,
\]
where the idendities $\langle \w{\omega}, \w{v} \rangle = \langle {}^{\Hor}\!\w{\omega}, \w{v} \rangle$
and $\langle \w{\omega}, \Lie{\el} \w{v} \rangle =  \langle {}^{\Hor}\!\w{\omega}, \Lie{\el} \w{v} \rangle$
hold by the very definition of ${}^{\Hor}\!\w{\omega}$,
since $\w{v}$ and $\Lie{\el}\w{v}$ are tangent\footnote{$\Lie{\el}\w{v}$ is tangent to
$\Hor$ for both $\wl$ and $\w{v}$ are tangent to $\Hor$.}
to $\Hor$. It follows then from (\ref{e:neh:Lie_l_Homeg_zero}) that $\langle \Lie{\el} \w{\omega}, \w{v} \rangle = 0$; hence the
first term in Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:zeroth_law_step2}) vanishes identically and there remains
only:
\be \label{e:neh:DS_kappa_W}
    \wnab_{\w{v}} \, \kappa = - \w{R}(\wl, \w{v}) .
\ee

To go further, we shall assume the
\defin{null dominance condition}\index{null!dominance condition}\index{dominance!null -- condition} \cite{Racz08}, namely that there
exists a scalar field $f$ such that
\be \label{e:neh:null_dominant_cond}
  \encadre{  \begin{array}{ll}
    \mbox{the vector} \ \w{W} := - \vw{G}(\wl) - f \wl \ & \mbox{is zero or future-directed (null or timelike)} \\
    & \mbox{for any future-directed null vector $\wl$}
    \end{array} } .
\ee
In the above equation, $\vw{G}$ stands for the type-$(1,1)$ tensor
associated by metric duality to the Einstein tensor\index{Einstein!tensor}
$\w{G}$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:bas:Einstein_tensor})], so that the expression of $\w{W}$
in index notation is [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:bas:arrow_endo_index})]
\be \label{e:neh:def_W_index}
    W^\alpha := - G^\alpha_{\ \, \mu} \el^\mu - f \ell^\alpha .
\ee
Note that the null dominance condition implies the null convergence condition
(\ref{e:neh:null_energy_cond}) since
\be \label{e:neh:R_ll_W_l}
    \w{R}(\wl, \wl) = \w{R}(\wl, \wl) - \frac{R}{2} \underbrace{\w{g}(\wl, \wl)}_{0}
    + f \underbrace{\w{g}(\wl, \wl)}_{0}  =  \w{G}(\wl, \wl) + f \w{g}(\wl,\wl)
     =  - \w{W}\cdot\wl \geq 0 ,
\ee
the inequality holding because both $\w{W}$ and $\wl$ are future-directed
(cf. Lemma~\ref{p:fra:lem2}).

If gravity is described by general relativity, i.e. if the metric $\w{g}$
fulfills the Einstein equation (\ref{e:fra:Einstein_eq_G}), then
the null dominance condition with $f = \Lambda$ is
equivalent to the
\defin{null dominant energy condition}\index{null!dominant energy condition}\index{energy!condition!null dominant --}:
\be \label{e:neh:null_dominant_cond_T}
  \encadre{ \begin{array}{ll}
    \mbox{The vector} \ \w{W} := - \vw{T}(\wl) \ & \mbox{is zero or future-directed (null or timelike)} \\
    & \mbox{for any future-directed null vector $\wl$}
    \end{array} }_{\rm \, GR},
\ee
where $\w{T}$ is the energy-momentum tensor of matter and non-gravitational fields.
By continuity, the null dominant energy condition is implied by the standard
\defin{dominant energy condition}\index{dominant energy condition}\index{energy!condition!dominant --}:
\be
   \begin{array}{ll}
     \mbox{The vector} \ \w{W} := - \vw{T}(\w{u}) \ & \mbox{is zero or future-directed (null or timelike)} \\
    & \mbox{for any future-directed timelike vector $\w{u}$}
    \end{array}  .
\ee
Physically,
the dominant energy condition states that, with respect to any
observer (represented by its 4-velocity $\w{u}$, which is future-directed timelike),
the energy of matter and non-gravitational fields does not move faster than light
(see Ref.~\cite{Carte03} for an extended discussion).

\begin{remark}
While the name \emph{null convergence condition} for $\w{R}(\wl,\wl) \geq 0$
[Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:null_energy_cond})] is standard in the literature
(e.g. \cite{HawkiE73,Senov22a,SenovG15}), the name \emph{null dominance condition}
for (\ref{e:neh:null_dominant_cond}) is not standard. We are using it to
distinguish from the \emph{null dominant energy condition} (\ref{e:neh:null_dominant_cond_T}),
which a condition on the matter energy-momentum tensor, while (\ref{e:neh:null_dominant_cond})
is a pure geometrical identity, independent of the Einstein equation. In this way,
\emph{null dominance condition} is on the same footing as \emph{null convergence condition}.
\end{remark}

Coming back to Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:DS_kappa_W}), we note that its right-hand side
is nothing but the scalar product of the vector $\w{W}$
defined by Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:null_dominant_cond}) with $\w{v}$:
\[
    \w{W}\cdot\w{v} = - (\vw{G}(\wl) + f \wl)\cdot\w{v}
    = - \w{R}(\wl, \w{v}) + \left( \frac{R}{2} - f \right) \underbrace{\wl\cdot\w{v}}_{0}
    = - \w{R}(\wl, \w{v}) .
\]
If we assume the null dominance condition, the null convergence condition
holds, so that $\w{R}(\wl, \wl) = 0$ on $\Hor$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:R_l_l_zero})].
Then, according to Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:R_ll_W_l}),
$\wl \cdot \w{W} = - \w{R}(\wl, \wl) = 0$.
This implies that the vector $\w{W}$ is tangent to $\Hor$. The latter
being a null hypersurface, $\w{W}$ must then be
either collinear to $\wl$ or spacelike (cf. Lemma~\ref{p:def:tangent_to_null_hyp} in Sec.~\ref{s:def:spacelike_sections}).
Now, according to the null dominance condition (\ref{e:neh:null_dominant_cond}),
$\w{W}$ cannot be
spacelike. We conclude that $\w{W}$ is collinear to $\wl$. Consequently,
we have $\w{W}\cdot\w{v} = 0$.
Hence the right-hand side of Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:DS_kappa_W}) vanishes identically
and we are left with $\wnab_{\w{v}} \, \kappa = 0$. Since $\w{v}$ is a generic
vector field tangent to $\Sp$ and $\Sp$ is connected (for it is a complete cross-section
of a Killing horizon, which is connected by definition),
this implies that
$\kappa$ is constant over $\Sp$. Given that $\kappa$ is
constant along each null geodesic generator of $\Hor$, this completes the demonstration
that $\kappa$ is constant over $\Hor$. More precisely, we have established
the following property:

\begin{prop}[zeroth law of black hole dynamics]
\label{p:neh:zeroth_law}
If the null dominance condition
(\ref{e:neh:null_dominant_cond})
is fulfilled on a Killing horizon $\Hor$ --- which is guaranteed in general relativity
if the null dominant energy condition (\ref{e:neh:null_dominant_cond_T}) holds ---, then the non-affinity coefficient $\kappa$
of the null normal coinciding with the Killing vector $\w{\xi}$ defining $\Hor$
is constant over $\Hor$:
\be \label{e:neh:zeroth_law}
    \encadre{\kappa = \mathrm{const}.}
\ee
\end{prop}
In the context of Killing horizons, the non-affinity coefficient $\kappa$ is
called the horizon's \defin{surface gravity}\index{surface!gravity},
for a reason to be detailed in Sec.~\ref{s:neh:surface_gravity},
and the result
(\ref{e:neh:zeroth_law}) is known as the
\defin{zeroth law of black hole dynamics}\index{zeroth law!of BH dynamics}. More precisely,
the zeroth law --- to be discussed in detail in Chap.~\ref{s:evo} ---
states that the surface gravity of a black hole in equilibrium is
constant and we shall see in Chap.~\ref{s:sta} that (any connected part of)
the event horizon of a black hole in equilibrium is a Killing horizon.


\begin{remark}
\label{r:neh:proof_zeroth_law}
The standard proof of the zeroth law, based on taking the covariant derivative
of Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:xi_nab_xi_kappa}) \cite{BardeCH73,Carte87,Wald84} or of Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:dxi2_kappa})
\cite{Heusl96} and on an identity expressing the second order derivative of
a Killing vector in terms of the Riemann tensor [Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:nabnab_xi_Riem}) below], is quite long (see
e.g. pp.~333-334 of Wald's textbook~\cite{Wald84} and the remark at the end of Sec.~5.5.2 of Poisson's
textbook \cite{Poiss04}). The proof presented above is shorter but it relies on
the concept of induced affine connection on a non-exanding horizon
(Sec.~\ref{e:neh:induced_connection}) and the associated rotation
1-form\index{rotation!1-form} ${}^{\Hor}\!\w{\omega}$ (cf.
Property~\ref{p:neh:Hnab_l}). This proof is actually adapted from a proof
presented by Damour\index[pers]{Damour, T.} \cite{Damou79,Damou82} (cf. historical note below); see
also Ref.~\cite{AshteBL01} for a related proof regarding isolated horizons.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
\label{r:neh:zero_law_wo_NDEC}
The constancy of $\kappa$ on a Killing horizon can also be proved without the
null dominance condition, but at the price of additional hypotheses:
either the Killing horizon $\Hor$ is part of a so-called bifurcate Killing horizon,
as we shall see in Sec.~\ref{s:neh:zeroth_law_bifur} (Property~\ref{p:neh:zeroth_law_bifur})
or the spacetime is axisymmetric, in addition to be stationary, and
the two Killing vectors associated
with stationarity and
axisymmetry are orthogonal to $(n-2)$-dimensional
surfaces \cite{Carte73b,RaczW96}.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}[null hyperplane as a translation-Killing horizon]
\label{x:neh:transKH_kappa}
For the null hyperplane $\Hor$ considered in Example~\ref{x:neh:transKH} as a Killing horizon with respect to the translation group along its normal, we have
$\kappa = 0$, as already noticed in Example~\ref{x:def:null_hyp3} of Chap.~\ref{s:def},
which is obviously constant over $\Hor$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[null hyperplane as a boost-Killing horizon]
\label{x:neh:boostKH_kappa}
Let us consider each of the null half-hyperplanes $\Hor^+$
and $\Hor^-$ of Example~\ref{x:neh:boostKH}, which are Killing horizons with
respect to the boost Killing vector $\w{\xi} = x \wpar_t + t \wpar_x$. On
$\Hor^+$, the future-directed null normal coinciding with this Killing vector
is $\wl^+ = t\,  \wl$, $\wl$ being the geodesic null normal defined by
$\wl:= \wpar_t + \wpar_x$ [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:def:wl_null_hyperplane})].
Using $\kappa_{\wl} = 0$ and the scaling law (\ref{e:def:rescale_kappa}),
we get the non-affinity
coefficient of $\wl^+$ as $\kappa_+= \wnab_{\wl} t = \partial_t t + \partial_x t$, i.e.
\[
    \kappa_+ = 1 .
\]
On $\Hor^-$, $\w{\xi}$ is past-directed (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:neh:hplaneKilling-boost}).
Sticking to future-directed null normals, we shall then consider $\Hor^-$
as a Killing horizon with respect to the Killing vector field $-\w{\xi}$.
The future-directed null normal coinciding with $-\w{\xi}$ on $\Hor^-$ is then
$\wl^- = -t\,  \wl$, from which we deduce the non-affinity
coefficient of $\wl^-$: $\kappa_-= \wnab_{\wl} (-t) = \partial_t (-t) + \partial_x (-t)$, i.e.
\[
    \kappa_- = -1 .
\]
We check that $\kappa_+$ (resp.  $\kappa_-$) is constant over the Killing horizon $\Hor^+$ (resp. $\Hor^-$), in agreement with Property~\ref{p:neh:zeroth_law}.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[null hyperplane as a null-rotation-Killing horizon]
\label{x:neh:nullrotKH_kappa}
In Example~\ref{x:neh:nullrotKH}, we have introduced the Killing horizons
$\Hor_1$ and $\Hor_2$ with respect to the null-rotation Killing vector
$\w{\xi} = y( \wpar_t + \wpar_x ) + (t-x)\wpar_y$ of Minkowski spacetime.
On $\Hor_1$, $\w{\xi}$ is past-directed (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:neh:hplaneKilling-nullrot}),
so that we shall actually consider $\Hor_1$
as a Killing horizon with respect to the Killing vector field $-\w{\xi}$.
The future-directed null normal coinciding with $-\w{\xi}$ on $\Hor_1$ is then
$\wl_1 = - y\, \wl$. Since it is clearly constant along the null geodesic generators
of $\Hor_1$, we have $\wnab_{\wl_1}\wl_1 = 0$, hence the
associated non-affinity coefficient vanishes: $\kappa_1 = 0$.
On $\Hor_2$, $\w{\xi}$ is future-directed (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:neh:hplaneKilling-nullrot})
and the null normal coinciding with it is $\wl_2 =  y\,  \wl$, whose non-affinity
coefficient is $\kappa_2 = 0$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Schwarzschild and Kerr horizons]
\label{x:neh:Schw_Kerr_kappa}
We have found in Example~\ref{x:def:Schw_hor3} of Chap.~\ref{s:def} [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:def:kappa_Schw_hor})]
that on a Schwarzschild horizon $\kappa = 1/(4m)$,
which is clearly constant. But
this last feature is rather trivial since the Schwarzschild horizon is spherically
symmetric, so that no dependence of $\kappa$ on $\th$ nor $\ph$ could have been expected.
A much less trivial example is that of the event horizon of a Kerr black hole,
which we shall discuss in Chap.~\ref{s:ker}. This horizon is only axisymmetric,
so that a priori $\kappa$ could depend on $\th$. But it does not, as we shall
see in Sec.~\ref{s:ker:surf_grav}:
\[
    \kappa = \frac{\sqrt{m^2 - a^2}}{2m(m + \sqrt{m^2-a^2})} ,
\]
where $(m,a)$ are the two constant parameters of the Kerr solution. Note that for $a=0$,
we recover the Schwarzschild value: $\kappa= 1/(4m)$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Cubic Galileon black hole as a counter-example]
It has been found recently that the surface gravity of rotating stationary black holes
in a scalar-tensor theory of gravity known as the \emph{cubic Galileon}\index{cubic Galileon}
is not constant \cite{Grand24}.
This evades the zeroth law (Property~\ref{p:neh:zeroth_law})
because the null dominance condition is not satisfied by these solutions.
\end{example}

\begin{hist}
The constancy of $\kappa$ for a Killing horizon has been proven by Stephen Hawking\index[pers]{Hawking, S.W.}
in his lecture at the famous 1972 Les Houches Summer School \cite{Hawki73} (p.~43).
It has also been proven without requiring the null dominance condition, but
assuming axisymmetry and orthogonal transitivy\index{orthogonally transitive} (cf. Remark~\ref{r:neh:zero_law_wo_NDEC} on p.~\pageref{r:neh:zero_law_wo_NDEC}) by Brandon Carter\index[pers]{Carter, B.} in his lecture at the same summer
school
\cite{Carte73b} (Theorem 8, p.~167).
A third proof of the constancy of $\kappa$, using the null dominance condition,
has also been given in 1973 by James Bardeen\index[pers]{Bardeen, J.M.}, Brandon Carter and
Stephen Hawking
in their seminal article \emph{The Four Laws of Black Hole Mechanics}
\cite{BardeCH73}. Yet another proof has been provided in 1979 by Thibault Damour\index[pers]{Damour, T.}
\cite{Damou79,Damou82}, who developed a fluid-bubble approach to the dynamics of an event horizon.
In Damour's framework, the pullback of the 1-form  $-\w{\omega}/(8\pi)$ to the cross-section
$\Sp$ is considered as the momentum surface density of the fluid bubble and Eq.~(\ref{e:def:0law_prov})
is turned into a 2-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation (see e.g. Sec.~6.3 of Ref.~\cite{GourgJ06} for details), where $\kappa/(8\pi)$ plays the role of the
bubble's surface pressure, so that it must constant in equilibrium. As mentioned in Remark~\ref{r:neh:proof_zeroth_law},
the proof presented above is derived from Damour's one.
\end{hist}

\subsection{Classification of Killing horizons} \label{s:neh:classif_KH}

Since $\kappa$ is constant on a Killing horizon $\Hor$ (assuming the null dominance
condition), we may use it to classify Killing horizons in two
categories, depending whether $\kappa$ vanishes or not:
\begin{itemize}
\item if $\kappa = 0$, the Killing vector $\w{\xi}$ is a geodesic vector on $\Hor$
and $\Hor$ is called a \defin{degenerate Killing horizon}\index{degenerate!Killing horizon}\index{Killing!horizon!degenerate --};
\item if $\kappa \not=0$, $\w{\xi}$ is only a pregeodesic vector on $\Hor$
(cf. Sec.~\ref{s:geo:gener_param})
and $\Hor$ is called a \defin{non-degenerate Killing horizon}\index{non-degenerate!Killing horizon}\index{Killing!horizon!non-degenerate --}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{example}[Killing horizons in Minkowski spacetime]
In Minkowski spacetime, the null hyperplane as a translation-Killing horizon
(Example~\ref{x:neh:transKH_kappa}) and the two half-hyperplanes as
null-rotation-Killing horizons (Example~\ref{x:neh:nullrotKH_kappa}) are
degenerate Killing horizons, while the two half-hyperplanes as
boost-Killing horizons (Example~\ref{x:neh:boostKH_kappa}) are non-degenerate.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Schwarzschild and Kerr horizons]
From the values of $\kappa$ given in Example~\ref{x:neh:Schw_Kerr_kappa},
we see that the Schwarzschild horizon and the Kerr horizon for
$a<m$ are non-degenerate Killing horizons, while the Kerr horizon for
$a=m$ is a degenerate one.
\end{example}

The next example regards the anti-de Sitter spacetime and will play some
role in the study of the extremal ($a=m$) Kerr black hole in Chap.~\ref{s:exk}.

\emph{Left:} 2-dimensional slice $(x,y)=(0,0)$ of the Poincaré patch $\M_{\rm P}$ of anti-de Sitter spacetime plotted in terms of the (global) coordinates $\tau$ and
$x_\chi := \chi \cos\ph$ (pale yellow region). From Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:Poincare_coord}),
$(x,y)=(0,0)$ implies $\th=\pi/2$ and $\ph=0$ or $\pi$, so that $x_\chi = \chi$
in the right half of the plot ($\ph=0$) and $x_\chi = - \chi$ in the left half
($\ph=\pi$). The plotted slice of $\M_{\rm P}$ is thus spanned by the
Poincaré coordinates $(t,u)$.
The red lines are curves of constant $u$, i.e. integral curves of
the coordinate vector field $\wpar_t = \w{\xi}$, with $u$ increasing from $0$ to $+\infty$
from the right to the left of the diagram. The grey lines are
curves of curves
of constant $t$, i.e. integral curves of the coordinate vector field $\wpar_u$,
with $t$ increasing from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$ from the bottom to the top
of the diagram. The Poincaré horizon $\Hor$ is depicted in green.
The two connected components $\Hor_-$ and $\Hor_+$ of $\Hor$
appear as straight line segments, since for $\th=\pi/2$
and $\ph\in\{0,\pi\}$, $u = 0 \iff \cos\tau = \pm \sin\chi$ ($+$ for $\ph=0$ and $-$ for $\ph=\pi$).
Note that the curves of constant $u$ tend to $\Hor$ when $u\to 0$, in agreement
with the characterization of $\Hor$ by $u=0$. The curves of constant
$t$ tend to $\Hor$ when $t\to \pm\infty$, which is expected as well since
the first line of Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:Poincare_coord}) and Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:AdS:def_u})
imply that $u\to 0$ for $t\to \pm\infty$.

$(\tau,r,\th,\ph)$ are given by
\be \label{e:neh:AdS4}
    \w{g} = \ell^2 \left[ - (1 + r^2) \, \dd \tau^2
    + \frac{\dd r^2}{1 + r^2} + r^2 \left( \dd\th^2 + \sin^2\th \, \dd\ph^2 \right) \right] ,
\ee
where $\ell$ is a positive constant.
Note that $\tau$ spans $\mathbb{R}$, $r$ spans $(0,+\infty)$,
while $(\th,\ph)$ are standard spherical coordinates on $\mathbb{S}^2$:
$\th\in(0,\pi)$ and $\ph\in(0,2\pi)$.
The metric (\ref{e:neh:AdS4}) is a solution to
the vacuum Einstein equation\index{Einstein!equation!vacuum --}\index{vacuum!Einstein equation} (\ref{e:fra:vac_Einstein_Lambda}) with
the negative cosmological constant $\Lambda = - 3/\ell^2$.
Using the so-called \emph{conformal coordinates} $(\tau,\chi,\th,\ph)$ with
$\chi := \arctan r \in (0,\pi/2)$, one gets
\be \label{e:neh:metrix_AdS_conformal}
   \w{g} = \frac{\ell^2}{\cos^2\chi} \left[ - \dd \tau^2
    + \dd \chi^2 + \sin^2\chi \left( \dd\th^2 + \sin^2\th \, \dd\ph^2 \right) \right] .
\ee
Note that $(\chi,\th,\ph)$ spans one half\footnote{It would span the whole hypersphere if
$\chi$ would run in all of $(0,\pi)$, instead of being limited to $(0,\pi/2)$.} of the hypersphere\index{hypersphere} $\mathbb{S}^3$.
Yet another set of coordinates commonly used in AdS$_{4}$ is \defin{Poincaré coordinates}\index{Poincaré!coordinates on AdS$_n$} $(t,x,y,u)$. They cover only a subpart
$\M_{\rm P}$ of $\M$ (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:neh:AdS_example}), usually called the \defin{Poincaré patch}\index{Poincaré!patch!of AdS$_4$} and defined by
\be \label{e:neh:def_Poincare_patch}
    \M_{\rm P}:\quad u > 0 \qand -\pi < \tau < \pi,
\ee
where $u$ is the following scalar field on $\M$:
\be \label{e:neh:AdS:def_u}
    u :=  \frac{\ell (\cos\tau - \sin\chi\sin\th\cos\ph)}{\cos\chi} .
\ee
On $\M_{\rm P}$, the Poincaré coordinates $(t,x,y,u)$ are related to the conformal coordinates
$(\tau,\chi,\th,\ph)$ by\footnote{See e.g. Ref.~\cite{BayonB07}.}
\be \label{e:neh:Poincare_coord}
    \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
    t = \frac{\ell \sin\tau}{\cos\tau - \sin\chi\sin\th\cos\ph} \\[1ex]
    x = \frac{\ell \sin\chi\sin\th\sin\ph}{\cos\tau - \sin\chi\sin\th\cos\ph} \\[1ex]
    y = \frac{\ell \sin\chi\cos\th}{\cos\tau - \sin\chi\sin\th\cos\ph} \\[1ex]
    u = \frac{\ell (\cos\tau - \sin\chi\sin\th\cos\ph)}{\cos\chi} .
    \end{array}\right.
\ee
The last line is simply (\ref{e:neh:AdS:def_u}) restricted to $\M_{\rm P}$, the scalar field $u$
being viewed there as one of the Poincaré coordinates.
The metric components with respect to Poincaré coordinates\footnote{The name \emph{Poincaré coordinates} stems from a variant of these coordinates obtained by using
$z:=\ell^2/u$ instead of $u$, so that
$\w{g} = \ell^2 \left( - \dd t^2 + \dd x^2 + \dd y^2 + \dd z^2 \right)/z^2$,
which is similar to the metric of the Poincaré half-space\index{Poincaré!half-space} model of
the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^4$, except for the signature $(-,+,+,+)$
instead of $(+,+,+,+)$.}
are (cf. the notebook~\ref{s:sam:Poincare_hor} for the computation):
\be \label{e:neh:AdS:metric_Poincare}
   \w{g} = \frac{u^2}{\ell^2} \left( - \dd t^2 + \dd x^2 + \dd y^2 \right)
   + \frac{\ell^2}{u^2} \, \dd u^2 .
\ee
The \defin{Poincaré horizon}\index{Poincaré!horizon of AdS$_4$}
is the hypersurface $\Hor$ bounding the Poincaré patch $\M_{\rm P}$ in $\M$. In view of the definition
(\ref{e:neh:def_Poincare_patch}) of the latter, $\Hor$ appears to be the level set $u=0$:
\be \label{e:neh:def_Poincare_hor}
    \Hor:\quad u = 0 \qand -\pi < \tau < \pi,
\ee
Note that $\Hor$ is not included in $\M_{\rm P}$, so that the Poincaré coordinates are not
defined on $\Hor$ (except for $u$, they actually diverge in the vicinity of $\Hor$).
Note also that $\Hor$ has two connected components: $\Hor_-$, where
$\tau \in (-\pi,0)$, and $\Hor_+$, where $\tau \in (0,\pi)$, since $u=0$
cannot be achieved for $\tau=0$, as a consequence of
formula~(\ref{e:neh:AdS:def_u}) and $|\sin\chi|<1$ on $\M$.
The Poincaré horizon is depicted in Fig.~\ref{f:neh:AdS_example}.
Its normal is given by the gradient of $u$, so that the vector field
defined in all $\M$ by
$\w{k} := \vec{\wnab} u$ is normal
to $\Hor$ on $\Hor$.
Given expressions (\ref{e:neh:metrix_AdS_conformal}) and
(\ref{e:neh:AdS:def_u}) for respectively $\w{g}$ and $u$, the components
$k^\alpha = g^{\alpha\mu}\partial_\mu u$ of $\w{k}$ with respect to
conformal coordinates are
\be \label{e:neh:AdS:k_comp}
\w{k} = \frac{1}{\ell} \left[ \sin\tau \cos\chi \wpar_\tau
    + \left( \cos\tau \sin\chi - \sin\th\cos\ph \right) \wpar_\chi
    - \frac{\cos\th\cos\ph}{\tan\chi} \wpar_\th
    + \frac{\sin\ph}{\tan\chi\sin\th} \wpar_\ph \right] .
\ee
The scalar square of $\w{k}$ is $\w{k}\cdot\w{k} = k_\mu k^\mu = k^\mu \partial_\mu u$; we obtain
\be
    \w{k}\cdot\w{k} = \frac{u^2}{\ell^2} .
\ee
Hence $\w{k}\cdot\w{k} \equalH 0$, which implies that $\Hor$ is a null hypersurface.

Since the metric components (\ref{e:neh:AdS:metric_Poincare}) do not depend on $t$,
the vector field $\w{\xi}:=\wpar_t$ is a Killing vector of $(\M_{\rm P}, \w{g})$.
By inverting the Jacobian matrix associated with the change of coordinates
(\ref{e:neh:Poincare_coord}), we get the expression of $\w{\xi} = \wpar_t$ in terms of
conformal coordinates:
\be \label{e:neh:AdS:def_xi}
    \w{\xi} =
        \frac{1 - \cos\tau \sin\chi \sin\th \cos\ph}{\ell} \wpar_\tau
    - \frac{\sin\tau \cos\chi \sin\th \cos\ph}{\ell} \wpar_\chi
    - \frac{\sin\tau\cos\th\cos\ph}{\ell\sin\chi} \wpar_\th
    + \frac{\sin\tau\sin\ph}{\ell\sin\chi\sin\th}  \wpar_\ph .
\ee
A priori, $\w{\xi}$ is defined on $\M_{\rm P}$ only, but the
right-hand side of the above expression is regular on all $\M$. Hence, we
may use (\ref{e:neh:AdS:def_xi}) to define $\w{\xi}$ as a vector field on
all $\M$. It is depicted in the right panel of Fig.~\ref{f:neh:AdS_example}.
By analytical continuation, it is immediate that $\w{\xi}$ obeys the
Killing equation (\ref{e:neh:Killing_equation}) everywhere and not only
on $\M_{\rm P}$ (cf. the notebook~\ref{s:sam:Poincare_hor} for an explicit check). Hence $\w{\xi}$
is a Killing vector of the entire anti-de Sitter spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$.
By comparing Eqs.~(\ref{e:neh:AdS:k_comp}) and (\ref{e:neh:AdS:def_xi}),
we get
\be
    \w{\xi} = \frac{\sin\tau}{\cos\chi} \, \w{k}
        + \frac{u}{\ell^2} \left( \cos\tau \cos\chi \, \wpar_\tau
            - \sin\tau\sin\chi \, \wpar_\chi \right) .
\ee
Since $u \equalH 0$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:def_Poincare_hor})], it
follows immediately that, on $\Hor$, $\w{\xi}$ is collinear to
the null normal to $\Hor$: $\w{\xi} \equalH (\sin\tau/\cos\chi)\,  \w{k}$,
with $\sin\tau\neq 0$ (given that $\tau \neq 0$ on $\Hor$).
Hence, $\w{\xi}$ is normal to the null hypersurface $\Hor$. We therefore
conclude that each of the connected components $\Hor_-$
and $\Hor_+$ of the Poincaré horizon $\Hor$ is a Killing horizon
with respect to $\w{\xi}$.
Let us evaluate the
non-affinity coefficient $\kappa$ of $\w{\xi}$ on $\Hor_{\pm}$ via
formula (\ref{e:neh:dxi2_kappa}). First of all, we compute the
scalar square of $\w{\xi}$ by noticing that on $\M_{\rm P}$,
$\w{\xi} = \wpar_t$, so that $\w{\xi}\cdot\w{\xi} = g_{tt}$; with
$g_{tt}$ read on Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:AdS:metric_Poincare}), we get
\be \label{e:neh:AdS:xi_square}
    \w{\xi}\cdot\w{\xi} = - \frac{u^2}{\ell^2} .
\ee
By means of the global components (\ref{e:neh:metrix_AdS_conformal})
and (\ref{e:neh:AdS:def_xi}) of respectively $\w{g}$ and $\w{\xi}$,
one checks that formule (\ref{e:neh:AdS:xi_square})
holds in all $\M$. Given that
the right-hand side is negative wherever $u\neq 0$, it follows
that $\w{\xi}$ is timelike everywhere on $\M$, except on $\Hor$.
Furthermore, formula (\ref{e:neh:AdS:xi_square}) results in
$\dd(\w{\xi}\cdot\w{\xi}) = - 2 \ell^{-2} u\, \dd u$. Since
$u\equalH 0$, this implies $\dd(\w{\xi}\cdot\w{\xi}) \equalH 0$, so that
formula (\ref{e:neh:dxi2_kappa}) yields $\kappa = 0$.
We conclude that the two connected components of the Poincaré horizon of AdS$_{4}$
are degenerate Killing horizons.
\end{example}

\subsection{Interpretation of $\kappa$ as a ``surface gravity''}
\label{s:neh:surface_gravity}

In this section, we assume that $\Hor$ is a non-degenerate Killing horizon,
i.e. that $\kappa\not=0$.
Let $p\in\Hor$ and $\w{v}\in T_p\M$ be a vector \emph{transverse} to $\Hor$, i.e.
not tangent to $\Hor$. According to Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:dxi2_kappa}), we have
\[
    \wnab_{\w{v}} (\w{\xi}\cdot\w{\xi}) = - 2\kappa \, \w{\xi}\cdot\w{v} .
\]
The right-hand side of this expression does not vanish, because
$\kappa\not=0$ and $\w{\xi}\cdot\w{v} \not=0$ (since $\w{v}$ is not
tangent to $\Hor$). Hence we get
$\wnab_{\w{v}} (\w{\xi}\cdot\w{\xi}) \not= 0$.
In other words, the derivative of the scalar square $\w{\xi}\cdot\w{\xi}$
along any direction transverse to $\Hor$ does not vanish. Since
$\w{\xi}\cdot\w{\xi}=0$ on $\Hor$, we conclude that, in the vicinity of $\Hor$,
$\w{\xi}\cdot\w{\xi}<0$ on one side of $\Hor$ and $\w{\xi}\cdot\w{\xi}>0$ on the
other side:
\begin{prop}
In the vicinity of a non-degenerate Killing horizon $\Hor$, the Killing vector field $\w{\xi}$ is timelike on one side of $\Hor$, null on $\Hor$
and spacelike on the other side.
\end{prop}

Let us focus on the side of $\Hor$ where $\w{\xi}$ is timelike.
There we define the ``norm'' of $\w{\xi}$ by
\be \label{e:neh:def_V_norm_xi}
   \encadre{ V := \sqrt{-\w{\xi}\cdot\w{\xi}} } .
\ee
We have $V>0$ and the square of the gradient of $V$ provides a new expression
for $\kappa$:
\be  \label{e:neh:kappa2_nabV}
    \encadre{ \kappa^2 = \lim_{\Hor} \nabla_\mu V \nabla^\mu V } ,
\ee
where $\lim_{\Hor}$ stands for the limit as one approaches $\Hor$
from the timelike side, which implies $V\rightarrow 0$.
\begin{proof}
Let us consider the \defin{twist 3-form}\index{twist 3-form} $\w{\omega}$ defined by
\be \label{e:neh:def_twist_3form}
    \w{\omega} := \uu{\xi} \wedge \dd \uu{\xi}
\ee
or, using index notation,
\bea
    \omega_{\alpha\beta\gamma} & := &
    \xi_\alpha (\D \xi)_{\beta\gamma}
    + \xi_\beta (\D \xi)_{\gamma\alpha}
    + \xi_\gamma (\D \xi)_{\alpha\beta} \nonumber \\
        & = &
        \xi_\alpha \left( \nabla_\beta \xi_\gamma - \nabla_\gamma \xi_\beta \right)
        + \xi_\beta \left( \nabla_\gamma \xi_\alpha - \nabla_\alpha \xi_\gamma \right)
        + \xi_\gamma \left( \nabla_\alpha \xi_\beta - \nabla_\beta \xi_\alpha \right) .
        \label{e:neh:antisym_omega}
\eea
Killing equation (\ref{e:neh:Killing_equation}) enables us to simplify each term inside
parentheses in (\ref{e:neh:antisym_omega}), yielding
\be
    \omega_{\alpha\beta\gamma} = 2 \left(
        \xi_\alpha  \nabla_\beta \xi_\gamma
        + \xi_\beta  \nabla_\gamma \xi_\alpha
        + \xi_\gamma  \nabla_\alpha \xi_\beta \right) .
\ee
The ``square'' of $\w{\omega}$ is then
\bea
     \omega_{\mu\nu\rho} \, \omega^{\mu\nu\rho} & = & 4 \Big(
       \xi_\mu  \nabla_\nu \xi_\rho \, \xi^\mu  \nabla^\nu \xi^\rho
       + \xi_\mu  \nabla_\nu \xi_\rho \, \xi^\nu  \nabla^\rho \xi^\mu
       + \xi_\mu  \nabla_\nu \xi_\rho \, \xi^\rho  \nabla^\mu \xi^\nu
       \nonumber \\
       & & \quad + \xi_\nu  \nabla_\rho \xi_\mu \, \xi^\mu  \nabla^\nu \xi^\rho
       + \xi_\nu  \nabla_\rho \xi_\mu \, \xi^\nu  \nabla^\rho \xi^\mu
       + \xi_\nu  \nabla_\rho \xi_\mu \, \xi^\rho  \nabla^\mu \xi^\nu
       \nonumber \\
       & & \quad + \xi_\rho  \nabla_\mu \xi_\nu \, \xi^\mu  \nabla^\nu \xi^\rho
       + \xi_\rho  \nabla_\mu \xi_\nu \, \xi^\nu  \nabla^\rho \xi^\mu
       + \xi_\rho \nabla_\mu \xi_\nu \, \xi^\rho  \nabla^\mu \xi^\nu  \Big)  . \nonumber
\eea
Now in the first line,
\be \label{e:neh:omega_square1}
  \xi_\mu  \nabla_\nu \xi_\rho \, \xi^\mu  \nabla^\nu \xi^\rho =
    \xi_\mu  \xi^\mu  \nabla_\nu \xi_\rho \nabla^\nu \xi^\rho =
    - V^2 \nabla_\nu \xi_\rho \nabla^\nu \xi^\rho
    = - V^2 \nabla_\mu \xi_\nu \nabla^\mu \xi^\nu
\ee
and (using Killing equation (\ref{e:neh:Killing_equation}))
\be \label{e:neh:omega_square2}
    \xi_\mu  \nabla_\nu \xi_\rho \, \xi^\nu  \nabla^\rho \xi^\mu
        =  \xi_\mu \nabla^\rho \xi^\mu \, \xi^\nu  \nabla_\nu \xi_\rho
        = - \xi_\mu \nabla^\rho \xi^\mu \, \xi^\nu  \nabla_\rho \xi_\nu
        = - \frac{1}{4} \nabla^\rho V^2 \, \nabla_\rho V^2
        = - V^2 \nabla^\rho V \, \nabla_\rho V  .
\ee
Actually, we notice that each line
is made of one term of type (\ref{e:neh:omega_square1})
and two terms of type (\ref{e:neh:omega_square2}). Hence
\be \label{e:neh:omega_square_V}
    \omega_{\mu\nu\rho} \, \omega^{\mu\nu\rho} = - 12 V^2
    \left( \nabla_\mu \xi_\nu \nabla^\mu \xi^\nu + 2 \nabla_\mu V \nabla^\mu V \right) .
\ee
On $\Hor$, each of the terms inside parentheses in Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:antisym_omega})
can be expressed thanks to the Frobenius identity (\ref{e:neh:Frobenius_xi}):
\[
    \omega_{\alpha\beta\gamma} \equalH
        \xi_\alpha \left( a_\beta \xi_\gamma - a_\gamma \xi_\beta \right)
        + \xi_\beta \left( a_\gamma  \xi_\alpha - a_\alpha  \xi_\gamma \right)
        + \xi_\gamma \left( a_\alpha \xi_\beta - a_\beta \xi_\alpha \right) .
\]
We notice that all terms in the right-hand side canceal two by two, yielding
\be \label{e:neh:omega_abc_zero}
    \omega_{\alpha\beta\gamma} \equalH 0 .
\ee
Equation~(\ref{e:neh:omega_abc_zero}) is actually nothing but
a variant of Frobenius theorem\index{Frobenius!theorem},
expressing the fact that the vector field $\w{\xi}$
is hypersurface-orthogonal on $\Hor$ (see e.g.
Eq.~(B.3.6) in Wald's textbook \cite{Wald84}, taking into account
that $\omega_{\alpha\beta\gamma} = 6 \xi_{[\alpha} \nabla_\beta \xi_{\gamma]}$).
Let us evaluate the gradient of the square
(\ref{e:neh:omega_square_V}) and take the limit
on $\Hor$:
\bea
    \nabla_\alpha \omega_{\mu\nu\rho} \, \underbrace{\omega^{\mu\nu\rho}}_{\to 0}
 + \underbrace{\omega_{\mu\nu\rho}}_{\to 0} \nabla_\alpha  \omega^{\mu\nu\rho} & =&
  - 12 \underbrace{\nabla_\alpha V^2}_{\to 2\kappa \xi_\alpha}
    \Big( \underbrace{\nabla_\mu \xi_\nu \nabla^\mu \xi^\nu}_{\to -2\kappa^2} + 2 \nabla_\mu V \nabla^\mu V \Big)
        \nonumber \\
 &  & - 12 \underbrace{V^2}_{\to 0}  \nabla_\alpha \left( \nabla_\mu \xi_\nu \nabla^\mu \xi^\nu + 2 \nabla_\mu V \nabla^\mu V \right) ,  \nonumber
\eea
where we have used Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:dxi2_kappa}) in the form $\nabla_\alpha V^2 \equalH 2 \kappa \xi_\alpha$, as well as expression~(\ref{e:neh:kappa2}) of $\kappa^2$. Hence we are left with
\[
    \kappa \left(  \nabla_\mu V \nabla^\mu V - \kappa^2 \right)
     \xi_\alpha \longrightarrow 0 \quad\mbox{on}\ \Hor .
\]
Now, by the very definition of a Killing horizon, $\xi_\alpha \not=0$ on $\Hor$.
Moreover, $\Hor$ being a non-degenerate Killing horizon, we have $\kappa\not=0$ as well.
The above limit is then equivalent to (\ref{e:neh:kappa2_nabV}).
\end{proof}

In the region where $\w{\xi}$ is timelike, the vector field
\be \label{e:neh:def_u_stationary_obs}
    \w{u} := \frac{1}{V}\, \w{\xi}
\ee
is a future-directed unit timelike vector field. It is future-directed
because by convention\footnote{Were $\w{\xi}$ past-directed, we could always
consider the Killing field $-\w{\xi}$ instead.} $\w{\xi}$ is future-directed
null on $\Hor$ and by continuity this orientation must be preserved in the
region where $\w{\xi}$ is timelike.
The unit vector field $\w{u}$ can be then considered as the 4-velocity
of an observer $\Obs$, whose worldline of is a field line of $\w{\xi}$,
i.e. an orbit of the isometry group generated by $\w{\xi}$.
One may call $\Obs$ a
\defin{stationary observer}\index{stationary!observer}\index{observer!stationary --}
since the spacetime geometry is not changing along its worldline.
The 4-acceleration of $\Obs$ is
\bea
    \w{a} & := & \wnab_{\w{u}}\, \w{u} \nonumber \\
        & = & \wnab_{V^{-1}\w{\xi}}\, \left( V^{-1} \w{\xi} \right)
        = V^{-1} \wnab_{\w{\xi}}\, \left( V^{-1} \w{\xi} \right)
        = V^{-1} \left[ - V^{-2} (\wnab_{\w{\xi}} V )\, \w{\xi}
            + V^{-1} \wnab_{\w{\xi}}\, \w{\xi} \right] . \nonumber
\eea
Now, since $\w{\xi}$ is a symmetry generator, $\wnab_{\w{\xi}} V =0$. This
can be shown explicitly by means of Killing equation (\ref{e:neh:Killing_equation}):
\[
    \wnab_{\w{\xi}} V = \xi^\mu \nabla_\mu( \sqrt{-\xi_\nu \xi^\nu} )
        = - \frac{1}{2\sqrt{-\xi_\nu \xi^\nu}} \, \xi^\mu \nabla_\mu( \xi_\nu \xi^\nu )
        = -\frac{1}{V}
            \underbrace{\xi^\mu \xi^\nu \nabla_\mu \xi_\nu}_{0}
        = 0 .
\]
We have thus
\be
    \w{a} = \frac{1}{V^2} \, \wnab_{\w{\xi}}\, \w{\xi} .
\ee
Thanks to Killing equation (\ref{e:neh:Killing_equation}), we may rewrite
this relation as
\[
    a_\alpha = \frac{1}{V^2} \, \xi^\mu \nabla_\mu \xi_\alpha
    = - \frac{1}{V^2} \, \xi^\mu \nabla_\alpha \xi_\mu
        = - \frac{1}{2V^2} \, \nabla_\alpha (\xi_\mu \xi^\mu)
        = \frac{1}{2V^2} \, \nabla_\alpha V^2
         =  \nabla_\alpha \ln V ,
\]
hence
\be
    \w{a} = \vw{\nabla} \ln V .
\ee
The norm of $\w{a}$, which is always a spacelike vector (since $\w{u}\cdot\w{u}=-1$ implies $\w{u}\cdot\w{a}=0$), is
\be
    a := \sqrt{\w{a}\cdot\w{a}} = \frac{1}{V} \sqrt{\nabla_\mu V \nabla^\mu V} .
\ee
Given the result (\ref{e:neh:kappa2_nabV}), we get an expression of $\kappa$
involving $a$:
\be \label{e:neh:kappa_lim_Va}
    \encadre{ \kappa = \lim_{\Obs\rightarrow\Hor} V a } ,
\ee
where $\Obs\rightarrow\Hor$ means that the limit is achieved by choosing
the worldline of observer $\Obs$ arbitrarily close to $\Hor$.
Since $V \rightarrow 0$ as one approaches $\Hor$, it follows that
\be \label{e:neh_diverging_accel}
     \lim_{\Obs\rightarrow\Hor} a = +\infty .
\ee
This means that the acceleration felt by observer $\Obs$ (the ``gravity'')
diverges as $\Obs$ approaches $\Hor$. In that sense,
the \emph{physical} surface gravity of $\Hor$ is infinite. But
Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:kappa_lim_Va}) shows that the rescaled acceleration
$V a$ remains finite as one approaches $\Hor$, and tends to $\kappa$.
It is this quantity that is
named the \defin{surface gravity}\index{surface!gravity}\index{gravity!surface --}
of the Killing horizon $\Hor$.

\begin{remark}
As stressed above, the surface gravity $\kappa$ is not the
actual gravity $a$ measured \emph{locally}, i.e. by an observer at rest with
respect to $\Hor$ and infinitely close to it. However, $\kappa$ can be interpreted
as a physical force (per unit mass) measured by a \emph{distant} observer,
at least in the special case of a Schwarzschild black hole, for which
$\w{\xi}$ is timelike in the entire region outside the Killing horizon\footnote{This is not true for a rotating Kerr black hole:
$\w{\xi}$ becomes null at some ``light-cylinder'' outside $\Hor$ and is then
spacelike away from it, cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:def_chi}),
where $\w{\xi}$ is denoted by $\w{\chi}$.}. In this case, one can identify $\kappa$
with the magnitude of the force exerted by an observer ``at infinity'' to hold in place a particle
of unit mass close to $\Hor$ by means of an infinitely long massless string
(see e.g. Sec.~5.2.4 of Poisson's textbook \cite{Poiss04}).

\section{Bifurcate Killing horizons} \label{s:sta:bifur_Killing_hor}

We extend here the study of Killing horizons
by introducing the concept of bifurcate Killing horizon, which is
particularly important for black hole physics.

\subsection{Definition and first properties} \label{s:sta:bifur_def}

\begin{greybox}
Let $(\M,\w{g})$ be a $n$-dimensional spacetime endowed with a Killing vector
field $\w{\xi}$. A
\defin{bifurcate Killing horizon}\index{bifurcate!Killing horizon}\index{Killing!horizon!bifurcate --}\index{horizon!bifurcate Killing --} is the
union
\be
    \Hor = \Hor_1 \cup \Hor_2 ,
\ee
such that
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Hor_1$ and $\Hor_2$ are two null hypersurfaces;
\item $\Sp:=\Hor_1\cap\Hor_2$ is a spacelike $(n-2)$-surface;
\item each of the sets $\Hor_1\setminus\Sp$ and $\Hor_2\setminus\Sp$ has two connected components, which are
Killing horizons with respect to $\w{\xi}$.
\end{itemize}
The $(n-2)$-dimensional submanifold $\Sp$ is called the
\defin{bifurcation surface}\index{bifurcation!surface} of $\Hor$.

\end{figure}

Hence we may say that a bifurcate Killing horizon is formed by four Killing horizons,
$\Hor_1^+$, $\Hor_1^-$, $\Hor_2^+$ and $\Hor_2^-$ say,
which are glued together at the bifurcation surface $\Sp$ (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:sta:bifur_Kill_hor}), in such a way that
\[
    \Hor_1 = \Hor_1^- \cup \Sp \cup \Hor_1^+ \quad \mbox{and}\quad
    \Hor_2 = \Hor_2^- \cup \Sp \cup \Hor_2^+
\]
are null hypersurfaces.

A first property of bifurcate Killing horizons is
\begin{prop}[vanishing of the Killing vector on the bifurcation surface]
\label{p:sta:xi_S_zero}
The Killing vector field vanishes on the bifurcation surface of
a bifurcate Killing horizon:
\be \label{e:sta:xi_S_zero}
    \encadre{\left. \w{\xi} \right| _{\Sp} = 0 } .
\ee
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Let $p\in \Sp$ and let us assume that $\left.\w{\xi}\right| _p\not=0$.
Let $\Li_1$ (resp. $\Li_2$) be the null geodesic generator of $\Hor_1$
(resp. $\Hor_2$) that intersects $\Sp$ at $p$ (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:sta:bifur_Kill_hor}).
By definition of a Killing horizon,
$\w{\xi}$ is tangent to $\Li_1\cap\Hor_1^+$ and to $\Li_1\cap\Hor_1^-$,
i.e. to $\Li_1\setminus\{p\}$.
If $\left.\w{\xi}\right| _p \not=0$, then by continuity,
$\w{\xi}$ is a (non-vanishing) tangent vector field all along $\Li_1$.
Similarly, $\w{\xi}$ is tangent to all $\Li_2$.
At their intersection point $p$, the geodesics $\Li_1$ and $\Li_2$ have thus a common tangent
vector, namely $\left.\w{\xi}\right| _p$.
The geodesic uniqueness theorem (Property~\ref{p:geo:exist_uniq_geod} in Appendix~\ref{s:geo})
then implies $\Li_1 = \Li_2$, so that
$\Li_1 \subset \Hor_1 \cap \Hor_2 = \Sp$. But since $\Sp$ is spacelike and
$\Li_1$ is null, we reach a contradiction. Hence we must have
$\left.\w{\xi}\right| _p = 0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
\label{r:sta:zero_Killing}
Having a Killing vector field that vanishes somewhere (here $\Sp$) is not the sign
of any pathology: it simply means that the points of $\Sp$ are fixed points of
the isometries generated by $\w{\xi}$, since
setting $\w{\xi}=0$ in Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:xi_dxdt}) leads to $\D\w{x}=0$, i.e.
to $\Phi_{\D t}(p) = p$.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
Contrary to what the name may suggest, a bifurcate Killing horizon is \emph{not}
a Killing horizon, for the latter, as defined in Sec.~\ref{s:neh:def_Killing_hor},
is a regular (i.e. embedded) hypersurface
of $\M$ (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:bas:embed} in Appendix~\ref{s:bas}), while
the union of two hypersurfaces is not in general a hypersurface. Moreover
on a Killing horizon, the Killing vector field is nowhere vanishing
[cf. Eq.~(\ref{s:neh:xi_on_KH})], while on
a bifurcate Killing horizon, it is vanishing at the bifurcation surface.
\end{remark}

surface $\Sp$ appears as a line, while it is actually a 2-plane.}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}[Lorentz-boost bifurcate Killing horizon]
\label{x:sta:bif-KH-boost}
Let us consider Minkowski spacetime and the Killing vector given
by Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:boost-Killing}): $\w{\xi} := x \wpar_t + t \wpar_x$, namely
the generator of Lorentz boosts in the $(t,x)$ plane.
Let us take for $\Hor_1$ the null hyperplane $t=x$
considered in Example~\ref{x:neh:boostKH} and denoted there
by $\Hor$. The two half-hyperplanes defined by
Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:boost-Killing_hor}) are then the Killing horizons $\Hor_1^+$ and
$\Hor_1^-$. The union $\Hor_1 \cup \Hor_2$, where $\Hor_2$ is the null hyperplane $t=-x$ is a bifurcate Killing horizon with respect to $\w{\xi}$,
with the 2-plane $(t,x)=(0,0)$ as bifurcation surface
(cf. Fig.~\ref{f:sta:hplane_bifur}). Note that on $\Hor_1$, the Killing vector
$\w{\xi}$ points away from $\Sp$, while on $\Hor_2$, it points towards $\Sp$,
as in the generic figure~\ref{f:sta:bifur_Kill_hor}.
\end{example}


\subsection{Non-degenerate Killing horizons and Boyer's theorem}
\label{s:sta:non-degenerate_KH}

Let us consider a Killing horizon $\Hor$ with respect to some Killing vector
$\w{\xi}$, such that the surface gravity\index{surface!gravity} $\kappa$
is constant over $\Hor$. According to the zeroth law (Property~\ref{p:neh:zeroth_law}), this
is guaranteed if the null dominance condition is fulfilled.
In what follows, we focus on the case where $\kappa\neq 0$, i.e. $\Hor$
is a non-degenerate Killing horizon (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:neh:classif_KH}).
In this case, the parameter $t$ of the null geodesic generators of $\Hor$
associated to $\w{\xi}$ is not affine
(for $\kappa$ is the non-affinity coefficient\index{non-affinity coefficient}
of $\w{\xi}$). However, we may
rescale $\w{\xi}$ to get an affine parameter, at the price of loosing
the Killing vector feature:


\begin{prop}[affine parametrization of a non-degenerate Killing horizon]
Let $\Hor$ be a Killing horizon (with respect to
a Killing vector $\w{\xi}$) of constant nonzero surface gravity $\kappa$.
Let $t$ be the parameter
of the null geodesic generators $\Li$ of $\Hor$
associated to $\w{\xi}$ ($\w{\xi} = \D\w{x}/\D t$ along $\Li$).
The null vector field $\wl$ defined on $\Hor$ by
\be \label{e:sta:el_kappa_xi}
    \wl = \mathrm{e}^{-\kappa t} \, \w{\xi} \quad \iff\quad
    \w{\xi} = \mathrm{e}^{\kappa t} \, \wl
\ee
is a geodesic vector field and the affine parameter associated to it is
\be \label{e:sta:lambda_t}
    \lambda = \frac{\mathrm{e}^{\kappa t}}{\kappa} + \lambda_0 ,
\ee
where $\lambda_0$ is constant along a given geodesic generator.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
We have
\[
\wnab_{\wl}\, \wl = \wnab_{\mathrm{e}^{-\kappa t} \w{\xi}} \left( \mathrm{e}^{-\kappa t} \, \w{\xi} \right) = \mathrm{e}^{-\kappa t} \wnab_{\w{\xi}} \left( \mathrm{e}^{-\kappa t} \, \w{\xi} \right)
= \mathrm{e}^{-\kappa t} \big[ \big( \underbrace{\wnab_{\w{\xi}} \mathrm{e}^{-\kappa t}}_{\D \mathrm{e}^{-\kappa t}/\D t} \big) \w{\xi}
    + \mathrm{e}^{-\kappa t} \underbrace{\wnab_{\w{\xi}}\, \w{\xi}}_{\kappa\w{\xi}}
    \big] = 0 .
\]
Hence $\wl$ is a geodesic vector. Besides, along any null generator of $\Hor$,
one has [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:bas:def_vector})]
\[
    \frac{\D\lambda}{\D t} = \w{\xi}(\lambda) = \mathrm{e}^{\kappa t}
    \underbrace{\wl(\lambda)}_{1} = \mathrm{e}^{\kappa t} ,
\]
which, once integrated, yields Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:lambda_t}).
\end{proof}

Let us assume $\kappa>0$ and consider a
null geodesic generator $\Li$ of $\Hor$; $\Li$ can be parameterized by $t$, the corresponding
tangent vector being $\w{\xi}$. When $t$ spans the whole interval $(-\infty,+\infty)$,
Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:lambda_t}) implies that $\lambda$ spans the
interval $(\lambda_0,+\infty)$ only. Since $\lambda$ is an affine parameter of $\Li$,
this means that $\Li$ is an \emph{incomplete} geodesic\index{incomplete geodesic}\index{geodesic!incomplete --} (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:geo:existence_uniqueness}).
Moreover, Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:el_kappa_xi}) leads to
\be \label{e:sta:xi_zero_t_inf}
    \w{\xi} \rightarrow 0 \quad\mbox{when}\quad t\rightarrow -\infty \qquad (\kappa>0).
\ee
In other words, the Killing vector field $\w{\xi}$ vanishes and
the null geodesic $\Li$ stops at the ``edge'' of $\Hor$ corresponding to
$t\rightarrow -\infty$.
If there is no obstacle (spacetime singularity or spacetime edge\footnote{A spacetime edge is generally not a genuine obstacle for extending an incomplete geodesic: it simply indicates
that the spacetime itself needs to be extended so that the geodesic becomes complete,
cf. Remark~\ref{r:sta:extension_bifurcate} below.}),
$\Li$ can be
extended to $\lambda\in(-\infty,\lambda_0]$, giving rise to a complete
null geodesic $\tilde\Li$. This operation can be performed for all the
null geodesic generators of $\Hor$ and we have the freedom to choose the same value
of $\lambda_0$ in Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:lambda_t}) for all of them. In this process,
one gives birth to a null hypersurface, $\tilde\Hor$ say, which contains $\Hor$. Let $\Sp\subset\tilde\Hor$ be the set of points of
affine parameter $\lambda=\lambda_0$ along all the extended null geodesics
$\tilde\Li$. $\Sp$ is clearly a cross-section of $\tilde\Hor$
(cf. Sec.~\ref{s:def:spacelike_sections}); it is then a
spacelike $(n-2)$-dimensional surface.
Assuming that $\w{\xi}$ is future-directed on $\Hor$,
$\Sp$ constitutes the past boundary of $\Hor$, i.e. the boundary corresponding to $t\rightarrow -\infty$.
Since $\w{\xi}$ is a smooth vector field on $\M$, Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:xi_zero_t_inf})
implies that $\w{\xi}$ vanishes on $\Sp$.
In other words, $\Sp$ is a set of fixed points for the isometry group generated
by $\w{\xi}$ (cf. Remark~\ref{r:sta:zero_Killing} above).
Let us denote by $\Hor^-$ the subset of $\tilde\Hor$
generated by the segments $\lambda<\lambda_0$ of the null geodesics $\tilde\Li$:
$\Hor^- = \tilde\Hor\setminus(\Hor\cup\Sp)$.
$\Hor^-$ is clearly a null hypersurface.
Since $\Sp$ is spacelike and $(n-2)$-dimensional, there are, at each point
$p\in\Sp$, only two null directions normal to $\Sp$ (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:def:spacelike_sections}). One of them is along $\wl$. The set of all null geodesics
departing from $\Sp$ along the other null direction forms a null hypersurface,
$\Hor_2^+$ say, in the future of $\Sp$ and another null hypersurface, $\Hor_2^-$
say, in the past of $\Sp$.
By studying the behavior of a Killing vector field around the set of its
fixed points (here $\Sp$), Boyer \cite{Boyer69} has shown that in
the current setting (i.e. $\Sp$ spacelike), $\w{\xi}$ acts \emph{locally}
as the generator of Lorentz boosts in Minkowski spacetime and $\Sp$ is the bifurcation surface
of a bifurcate Killing horizon similar to that of Example~\ref{x:sta:bif-KH-boost}
(cf. Fig.~\ref{f:sta:hplane_bifur}).
More precisely, Boyer proved the following:

\begin{prop}[Boyer's theorem\index{Boyer's theorem} \textnormal{(Boyer\index[pers]{Boyer, R.H.} 1969 \cite{Boyer69})}]
\label{p:sta:Boyer_thm}
A Killing horizon $\Hor$ with respect to a Killing vector $\w{\xi}$
is contained in a bifurcate Killing horizon if, and
only if, $\Hor$ contains at least one null geodesic orbit of the isometry group that is
complete as an orbit, i.e. such that the group parameter $t$ associated to $\w{\xi}$ takes
all values in $\R$, but that is incomplete and extendable as
a geodesic.
\end{prop}

That $\Hor$ contains an orbit that is an incomplete geodesic is guaranteed by
$\kappa\not=0$, as we have just seen.
It follows that $\Hor^-$, $\Hor_2^+$ and $\Hor_2^-$
are three Killing horizons, so that $\Hor\cup\Hor^-\cup\Hor_2^+\cup\Hor_2^-\cup\Sp$
is a bifurcate Killing horizon.

If $\kappa<0$, we see from Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:lambda_t}) that while $t$ spans the
whole interval $(-\infty,+\infty)$, the affine parameter $\lambda$ spans the
interval $(-\infty,\lambda_0)$ only. Moreover, Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:el_kappa_xi})
leads to
\be
    \w{\xi} \rightarrow 0 \quad\mbox{when}\quad t\rightarrow +\infty  \qquad (\kappa<0).
\ee
The reasoning developed for $\kappa>0$ can be applied mutatis mutandis,
leading to a bifurcate Killing horizon with a bifurcation surface $\Sp$ that
is the future boundary of $\Hor$. Hence we conclude:
\begin{prop}[non-degenerate Killing horizons and bifurcate Killing horizons]
\label{p:sta:non_degen_bifurcate}
The null geodesic generators of a non-degenerate Killing horizon $\Hor$ are
incomplete; if they can be extended, $\Hor$ is contained in a
bifurcate Killing horizon, the bifurcation surface of which is the past
(resp. future) boundary of $\Hor$ if $\kappa>0$ (resp. $\kappa<0$).
\end{prop}

\begin{remark}
\label{r:sta:extension_bifurcate}
It could be that the generators of $\Hor$ cannot be extended simply
because the spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$ is not been chosen ``large enough''.
I.~R\'acz\index[pers]{Racz, I.@R\'acz, I.} and R.M.~Wald\index[pers]{Wald, R.M.} \cite{RaczW96}
have shown that under some mild hypotheses (in particular that $(\M,\w{g})$ is globally
hyperbolic), one can extend $(\M,\w{g})$ to a larger spacetime with a bifurcate
Killing horizon containing $\Hor$.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
For a degenerate Killing horizon, the problem of extension disappears, since
$t$ is then an affine parameter of the null generators. Consequently if $t$ spans
the whole interval $(-\infty,\infty)$, the null generators are complete
geodesics. One can still have $\w{\xi}\rightarrow 0$ at some boundary
of $\Hor$, but this is a null boundary, not a spacelike one, and it does not
correspond to a bifurcation surface. An example is the Killing horizon with
respect to a null-rotation Killing vector in Minkowski spacetime, exhibited
as Examples~\ref{x:neh:nullrotKH} and \ref{x:neh:nullrotKH_kappa},
p.~\pageref{x:neh:nullrotKH} and \pageref{x:neh:nullrotKH_kappa}
respectively (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:neh:hplaneKilling-nullrot}): $\w{\xi}=0$
on the null 2-plane of equation $t=x$, $y=0$.
\end{remark}

\begin{hist} \label{h:sta:Boyer}
The concept of bifurcate Killing horizons has been introduced by Robert H. Boyer\index[pers]{Boyer, R.H.}
(1932-1966), a young American mathematical physicist who had just been appointed
to the University of Liverpool. Sadly, Boyer was killed, among 14 victims, in a mass murder that
occurred in the University of Texas at Austin on 1 August 1966.
His last notes, containing the definition of a bifurcate Killing horizon
and the proof of Property~\ref{p:sta:Boyer_thm}, have been turned into an article
by Jürgen Ehlers\index[pers]{Ehlers, J.} and John Stachel\index[pers]{Stachel, J.L.}, which has
been published in 1969 \cite{Boyer69}.
\end{hist}

\subsection{Zeroth law for bifurcate Killing horizons} \label{s:neh:zeroth_law_bifur}

For a Killing horizon that is part of a bifurcate Killing horizon, one can establish
the constancy of the surface gravity $\kappa$ (the ``zeroth law'') by means of the vanishing of
the Killing vector $\w{\xi}$
at the bifurcation surface, without requiring the null dominance condition as for a generic Killing horizon
in Property~\ref{p:neh:zeroth_law}:

\begin{prop}[zeroth law\index{zeroth law!of BH dynamics} for bifurcate Killing horizons]
\label{p:neh:zeroth_law_bifur}
The surface gravity is a nonzero constant over any Killing horizon that is part of a
bifurcate Killing horizon:
\be
    \encadre{\kappa = \mathrm{const} \neq 0.}
\ee
\end{prop}
The proof makes use of the following lemma:

\begin{lemma}[second derivative of a Killing vector]
For any Killing vector $\w{\xi}$, the following identity, often called the
\defin{Kostant formula}\index{Kostant formula}, holds:
\be \label{e:neh:nabnab_xi_Riem}
    \encadre{\nabla_\gamma \nabla_\beta \xi^\alpha = R^\alpha_{\ \, \beta\gamma\mu} \xi^\mu },
\ee
where $R^\alpha_{\ \, \beta\gamma\mu}$ is the Riemann curvature tensor of $\w{g}$.
The contraction on the indices $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ lets the Ricci tensor appear:
\be \label{e:neh:nabnab_xi_Ricci}
    \encadre{ \nabla_\mu \nabla_\alpha \xi^\mu = R_{\alpha\mu} \xi^\mu } .
\ee
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Consider
the covariant version of the Ricci identity (\ref{e:bas:Ricci_ident}):
$\nabla_\alpha\nabla_\beta \xi_\gamma - \nabla_\beta\nabla_\alpha \xi_\gamma
        = R_{\gamma\mu \alpha\beta} \, \xi^\mu$ and call it equation $(1)$.
Perform two successive cyclic permutations of the indices $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)$, leading
to equations $(2)$ and $(3)$, say. Then consider the linear combination $(1) - (2) - (3)$.
The left-hand side of it reduces to $2 \nabla_\gamma \nabla_\beta \xi_\alpha$
thanks to the Killing equation (\ref{e:neh:Killing_equation}), while the
right-hand side is $(R_{\gamma\mu \alpha\beta} - R_{\alpha\mu\beta\gamma} - R_{\beta\mu\gamma\alpha})\xi^\mu$.
Now, using the antisymmetries (\ref{e:bas:Riemann_antisym34}) and (\ref{e:bas:Riemann_antisym12}) of the Riemann tensor and then the cyclic symmetry (\ref{e:bas:Riemann_cyclic}), one has
$- R_{\alpha\mu\beta\gamma} - R_{\beta\mu\gamma\alpha} = - R_{\mu\alpha\gamma\beta} - R_{\mu\beta\alpha\gamma}
= R_{\mu\gamma\beta\alpha}$. This turns the right-hand side into $(R_{\gamma\mu \alpha\beta} + R_{\mu\gamma\beta\alpha})\xi^\mu = 2 R_{\gamma\mu \alpha\beta} \xi^\mu = 2 R_{\alpha\beta\gamma\mu} \xi^\mu$, the last equality resulting from
(\ref{e:bas:Riemann_sym}). This establishes Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:nabnab_xi_Riem}).
Finally, let us note that Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:nabnab_xi_Ricci}) can be proved directly, without appealing
to the cyclic property of the Riemann tensor: it suffices to use the the contracted Ricci identity (\ref{e:bas:contract_Ricci_ident}):  $\nabla_\mu \nabla_\alpha \xi^\mu - \nabla_\alpha \nabla_\mu \xi^\mu = R_{\mu\alpha} \xi^\mu = R_{\alpha\mu} \xi^\mu$ and the fact that $\nabla_\mu \xi^\mu = 0$ as a consequence
of Killing equation (\ref{e:neh:Killing_equation}).
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Property~\ref{p:neh:zeroth_law_bifur}]
Let $\Hor$ be a Killing horizon that is part of a bifurcate Killing horizon
$\hat{\Hor}$ with respect to a Killing vector $\w{\xi}$.
Let $\w{v}$ be a generic non-vanishing vector field tangent to $\Hor$. Let us
evaluate the derivative of $\kappa$ along $\w{v}$ from expression (\ref{e:neh:kappa2}):
\[ 2 \kappa \wnab_{\w{v}} \kappa =
    - \frac{1}{2} v^\rho \nabla_\rho \left( \nabla_\mu \xi_\nu \nabla^\mu \xi^\nu \right) =
    - v^\rho \nabla_\rho \nabla_\mu \xi_\nu \nabla^\mu \xi^\nu .\]
Using Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:nabnab_xi_Riem}) and the antisymmetry property~(\ref{e:bas:Riemann_antisym12}) to
set $-R_{\nu\mu\rho\sigma} = R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}$, we get
\be \label{e:neh:v_nab_kappa}
    2 \kappa \wnab_{\w{v}}  \kappa = v^\rho R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} \xi^\sigma \nabla^\mu \xi^\nu .
\ee
If the vector $\w{v}$ is chosen to be the null normal $\wl \equalH \w{\xi}$, one gets immediately
$2\kappa \wnab_{\wl}  \kappa = 0$, given that $R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} \xi^\rho \xi^\sigma = 0$
[Eq.~(\ref{e:bas:Riemann_antisym34})]. Then $\kappa = 0$ or $\wnab_{\wl}\kappa = 0$. In both
cases, this means that $\kappa$ must be constant along a given null generator $\Li$ of $\Hor$.
We thus recover the result (\ref{e:neh:kappa_const_along_L}).
There remains to prove that $\kappa$ does not vary from one generator to the other.
For this, we shall use that $\Hor$ belongs to the bifurcate Killing horizon $\hat{\Hor}$.
By virtue of Boyer's theorem (Property~\ref{p:sta:Boyer_thm}), one has $\kappa\neq 0$, for if $\kappa$
would be zero along $\Li$, the latter would be a complete geodesic and $\Hor$ could not be part of a
bifurcate Killing horizon. The bifurcation
surface $\Sp$ of $\hat{\Hor}$ is part of the topological closure of $\Hor$
(cf. Fig.~\ref{f:sta:bifur_Kill_hor}, with e.g. $\Hor_1^+$ standing for $\Hor$), so it is meaningfull to consider
the limit of Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:v_nab_kappa}) to $\Sp$ for a vector field $\w{v}$ on $\Hor$ that tends to a nonzero
vector field tangent to $\Sp$. Given that
$\w{\xi}\equalS 0$ and $\wnab\w{\xi}$ remains finite at $\Sp$ for
$\w{\xi}$ is a smooth vector field on $\M$, the limit yields (taking into account $\kappa\neq 0$)
$\wnab_{\w{v}}  \kappa \equalS 0$.
It follows that $\kappa$ (or more precisely the limit to $\Sp$ of $\Hor$'s surface gravity $\kappa$) is uniform
over $\Sp$. Each null generator $\Li$ of $\Hor$ is an incomplete geodesic, which once extended to a complete geodesic, intersects $\Sp$ at single point. The constancy of $\kappa$ on $\Sp$ implies then that $\kappa$ cannot vary from one
null generator to the other. $\kappa$ is thus uniform over $\Hor$.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}[Lorentz-boost bifurcate Killing horizon]
Let us consider the bifurcate Killing horizon $\hat{\Hor}$
of Minkowski spacetime discussed in Example~\ref{x:sta:bif-KH-boost} and illustrated
in Fig.~\ref{f:sta:hplane_bifur}. The corresponding Killing vector is
the Lorentz-boost generator $\w{\xi} := x \wpar_t + t \wpar_x$. An easy computation
yields $\wnab_{\w{\xi}} \w{\xi} = t \wpar_t + x \wpar_x$. On the components
$\Hor_1^+$ and $\Hor_1^-$ of $\hat{\Hor}$ (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:sta:hplane_bifur}),
one has $t=x$, so that $\w{\xi} =  t (\wpar_t + \wpar_x)$ and
$\wnab_{\w{\xi}} \w{\xi} = t (\wpar_t + \wpar_x)$. Hence $\wnab_{\w{\xi}} \w{\xi} = \w{\xi}$
and $\kappa = 1$ there.
On the components $\Hor_2^+$ and $\Hor_2^-$ of $\hat{\Hor}$ (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:sta:hplane_bifur}),
one has $t=-x$, so that $\w{\xi} =  t (-\wpar_t + \wpar_x)$
and
$\wnab_{\w{\xi}} \w{\xi} = t (\wpar_t - \wpar_x)$.
Hence  $\wnab_{\w{\xi}} \w{\xi} = - \w{\xi}$ and $\kappa = -1$ there.
We conclude that $\kappa$ is constant over any of the four Killing horizons
constituting $\hat{\Hor}$.
\end{example}

\begin{remark}
As the above example shows, the surface gravity is \emph{not} uniform over
all the bifurcate Killing horizon $\hat{\Hor}$; it keeps the same value only on the subsets $\Hor_1^-\cup \Hor_1^+$
and $\Hor_2^-\cup \Hor_2^+$.
\end{remark}


\begin{hist}
The proof of the zeroth law for Killing horizons that are part of a bifurcate Killing horizon (Property~\ref{p:neh:zeroth_law_bifur}) has been first presented by Bernard Kay\index[pers]{Kay, B.}
and Robert Wald\index[pers]{Wald, R.M.} in 1991 \cite{KayW91}; these authors mentioned that the proof had been suggested
to them by Robert Geroch\index[pers]{Geroch, R.}. The proof appears also in the notes from a lecture
