\section{Diffeomorphism-invariant theories of gravity}

\subsection{Framework}

We consider a generic metric theory of gravity on the spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$
constructed on a least action principle\index{least action}, with the following action:
\be \label{e:tha:action_L}
    \mathcal{S} = \int_{\M} \w{L} = \int_{\M} L \, \weps = \int_{\M} L \sqrt{-g} \, \D^n x .
\ee
Here $\w{L}$ is the \defin{Lagrangian $n$-form}\index{Lagrangian!form}\footnote{As the integral of a $n$-form over a $n$-dimensional manifold, $\mathcal{S}$ is well-posed and coordinate independent.},
$L$ is the \defin{Lagrangian scalar}\index{Lagrangian!scalar}
and
$\weps$ is the Levi-Civita tensor (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:bas:Levi-Civita_tensor}).
The second equality reflects the identity\footnote{Since the space of $n$-forms at any
point $p\in\M$ is 1-dimensional, $\w{L}$ and $\weps$ are
necessarily proportional, so that there is no loss of generality in the writing
$\w{L} = L \, \weps$.} $\w{L} = L \, \weps$ and the third one provides an expression of the integral
in terms of a coordinate system $(x^\alpha)$ on $\M$, $g$ being the determinant of
$\w{g}$ with respect to these coordinates [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:bas:eps_sqrt_g})].
Disregarding any matter field for simplicity,
we shall assume that $\w{L}$ is a function of the metric tensor only.
More precisely, we assume that at a given point $p\in\M$, $\w{L}$ depends only
on the values of $\w{g}$ and its derivatives at $p$. By \emph{derivative}, it is
meant derivative with respect to any affine connection on $\M$, for instance one
formed by the partial derivatives with respect to a coordinate system. We shall
write $\w{L(g)}$ to stress this dependency of $\w{L}$ on $\w{g}$, according
to the following notation


 the Riemann tensor and a finite number of symmetrized\footnote{There is no loss of generality in considering only symmetrized derivatives, since
any antisymmetrized combination can be reexpressed in term of the Riemann tensor itself and
lower order derivatives.} covariant derivatives of the latter:
\be \label{e:tha:Lagrangian_diffeo_inv}
    L = L\left(g_{\alpha\beta}, R_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}, \nabla_\lambda R_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta},\ldots,
    \nabla_{(\lambda_1} \cdots\nabla_{\lambda_m)} R_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta} \right) .
\ee
It can be shown \cite{IyerW94} that any diffeomorphism-invariant theory of gravity based on a Lagrangian
involving only the metric tensor and its derivatives (with respect to an arbitrary affine connection on $\M$) can
be recast in the form (\ref{e:tha:Lagrangian_diffeo_inv}).

\begin{example}
\label{x:tha:EH_Lagrangian}
For general relativity, $L$ is the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian\index{Einstein-Hilbert action}:
$L = (16\pi)^{-1} R = (16\pi)^{-1} g^{\mu\nu} R_{\mu\nu} =  (16\pi)^{-1} g^{\mu\nu} R^\sigma_{\ \,\mu\sigma\nu}$, hence $L = (16\pi)^{-1} g^{\mu\nu} g^{\rho\sigma} R_{\rho\mu\sigma\nu}$, which is of the form (\ref{e:tha:Lagrangian_diffeo_inv}).
\end{example}

By \emph{diffeomorphism-invariant} theory, it is meant
that the Lagrangian $n$-form $\w{L}$ is covariant under the group of diffeomorphisms of $\M$.
More precisely, under the action of a diffeomorphism $\Phi:\M \to \M$, the metric tensor
is transformed to its pullback $(\Phi^{-1})^*\w{g}$ by
$\Phi^{-1}$ (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:bas:push_pull} for the definition of the pullback).
The inverse of $\Phi$ is invoked here because, as $\w{g}$ is a
tensor of type $(0,2)$, $\Phi$ itself would carry it from\footnote{Since $\Phi$ is a diffeomorphism
$\M\to \M$, we have of course $\Phi(\M)=\M$; however we keep the notation $\Phi(\M)$ to stress the image character by $\Phi$.} $\Phi(\M)$ to $\M$, while
we are considering the transformation from $\M$ to $\Phi(\M)$ (cf. Remark~\ref{r:bas:comp_push_pull} on
p.~\pageref{r:bas:comp_push_pull}).
Let $\w{L}[(\Phi^{-1})^*\w{g}]$ be the Lagrangian $n$-form constructed by keeping the same functional
dependence in $(\Phi^{-1})^*\w{g}$ as $\w{L}$ has in $\w{g}$,
i.e. $\w{L}[(\Phi^{-1})^*\w{g}] := L((\Phi^{-1})^* g_{\alpha\beta}, R_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}[(\Phi^{-1})^*\w{g}], \ldots) \,
\weps[(\Phi^{-1})^*\w{g}]$
with the same function $L$ as in (\ref{e:tha:Lagrangian_diffeo_inv}).
In what follows, we shall denote by $\w{L}[\w{g}]$ the original Lagrangian $n$-form, instead of merely $\w{L}$.
The invariance of the theory under diffeomorphisms
amounts to demanding that, as a $n$-form on $\M$, $\w{L}[(\Phi^{-1})^*\w{g}]$ is nothing but
the $n$-form $\w{L}[\w{g}]$ transformed under the action of $\Phi$, i.e. the pullback of $\w{L}[\w{g}]$ by
$\Phi^{-1}$:  $\w{L}[(\Phi^{-1})^*\w{g}] = (\Phi^{-1})^*\w{L}[\w{g}]$.
Given that the spacetimes
$(\M, \w{g})$ and $(\Phi(\M),(\Phi^{-1})^* \w{g})$ are physically equivalent,
this means that $\w{L}[\w{g}]$ and $\w{L}[(\Phi^{-1})^*\w{g}]$ are basically the same object.
In particular, the action $\mathcal{S}$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:action_L})] takes the same value if
$\w{L}[(\Phi^{-1})^*\w{g}]$ is substituted for $\w{L}[\w{g}]$. If one interprets the diffeomorphism
action in a ``passive'' way, i.e. as a change of coordinates on $\M$, the
diffeomorphism-invariance condition simply means that the functional form of $L$
expressed in Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:Lagrangian_diffeo_inv}) does not depend upon
the choice of coordinates. Since the condition  $\w{L}[(\Phi^{-1})^*\w{g}] = (\Phi^{-1})^*\w{L}[\w{g}]$
must hold for any diffeomorphism, we may simplify it
by introducing $\Phi' := \Phi^{-1}$ and
renaming $\Phi'$ to $\Phi$:
\begin{greybox}
A gravitation theory is said
to be \defin{diffeomorphism-invariant}\index{diffeomorphism!invariance} iff
its Lagrangian $n$-form $\w{L}$ is \defin{covariant}\index{covariant} under the group
of diffeomorphisms of $\M$, i.e. iff for
any diffeomorphism $\Phi: \M \to \M$,
\be \label{e:tha:covariant_Lagrangian}
    \w{L}[\Phi^*\w{g}] = \Phi^*\w{L}[\w{g}] ,
\ee
where $\Phi^*$ stands for the pullback by $\Phi$, as defined in Sec.~\ref{s:bas:push_pull}.
\end{greybox}

A standard computation (see e.g \cite{Compe19,LeeW90}) leads to

\begin{prop}[variation of the Lagrangian of a pure metric theory]
\label{p:tha:var_Lagrangian}
Let $\w{L}$ be a Lagrangian $n$-form that depends only of the metric tensor $\w{g}$
and its derivatives, as in Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:Lagrangian_diffeo_inv}).
The variation of $\w{L}$ resulting from a generic variation $\delta\w{g}$ of $\w{g}$ is
expressible as
\be \label{e:tha:delta_L_E_Theta}
    \delta \w{L} = E^{\mu\nu} \delta g_{\mu\nu} \, \weps + \dd \w{\theta} ,
\ee
where $E^{\mu\nu}$ are the components of a symmetric type-$(2,0)$ tensor field $\w{E}$,
called the \defin{Euler-Lagrange tensor}\index{Euler-Lagrange!tensor},
and $\w{\theta}$ is a $(n-1)$-form, called the
\defin{symplectic potential form}\index{symplectic!potential form} \cite{IyerW94}.
The $n$-form $\dd \w{\theta}$ is the exterior derivative of $\w{\theta}$
(cf. Sec.~\ref{s:bas:ext_deriv}).
$\w{E}$ depends on $\w{g}$ but not on $\delta\w{g}$, while $\w{\theta}$
depends on both $\w{g}$ and $\delta\w{g}$, in a linear way for $\delta\w{g}$.
All these dependencies are \emph{local}: at a given point $p\in\M$, $\w{E}$ and $\w{\theta}$
depend only on the values of $\w{g}$, $\delta\w{g}$ and their derivatives at $p$.
We shall write $\w{E} = \w{E}[\w{g}]$ and $\w{\theta} = \w{\theta}[\w{g},\delta\w{g}]$
to stress these dependencies.

For a given $\w{L}$, the symplectic potential form is not unique: since
$\dd$ is nilpotent
[Eq.~(\ref{e:ext_der_nilpot})], $\w{\theta}$ in formula~(\ref{e:tha:delta_L_E_Theta})
can be substituted by
\be \label{e:tha:Theta_not_unique}
  \w{\theta'} = \w{\theta} + \dd \w{Y},
\ee
where $\w{Y}=\w{Y}[\w{g},\delta\w{g}]$ is an
arbitrary $(n-2)$-form that is a local function of $\w{g}$ and $\delta\w{g}$,
with a linear dependence on $\delta\w{g}$.
\end{prop}

\begin{notation}
In all this section, we shall use square brackets, e.g. $\w{\theta}[\w{g},\delta\w{g}]$, to
denote a \emph{local} function of tensor fields, as defined above.
\end{notation}

\begin{remark}
The term $\dd\w{\theta}$ collects all the derivatives of $\delta\w{g}$, which have been gathered
by means of the Leibniz rule, so that the term $E^{\mu\nu} \delta g_{\mu\nu} \, \weps$
in Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:delta_L_E_Theta}) does not contain any derivative of $\delta\w{g}$.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
For a given theory, the Lagrangian $n$-form itself is not unique:
$\w{L'} = \w{L} + \dd\w{\mu}$, where $\w{\mu}$ is an arbitrary $(n-1)$-form with compact
support, leads to the same action (\ref{e:tha:action_L}). If one takes this into account,
the full degrees of freedom $\w{\theta}$ are
$\w{\theta'} = \w{\theta} + \dd \w{Y} + \delta\w{\mu}$, instead of (\ref{e:tha:Theta_not_unique}).
However, for simplicity, we shall not consider $\w{\mu}$ here.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
For general relativity, one has $\w{L} = (16\pi)^{-1} R \weps$ (Example~\ref{x:tha:EH_Lagrangian}).
Given a coordinate system $(x^\alpha)$
on $\M$,
this can be rewritten as $\w{L} = (16\pi)^{-1} R \sqrt{-g} \, \w{e}$, where
$g$ is the determinant of $\w{g}$ with respect to $(x^\alpha)$ and
$\w{e}$ is the $n$-form whose components with respect to $(x^\alpha)$
are $e_{\alpha_1\cdots\alpha_n} = 1$ (resp. $-1$) if $(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n)$ is an
even (resp. odd) permutation of $(0,\ldots,n)$ and $0$ otherwise [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:bas:eps_sqrt_g})].
One has then $\delta\w{L} = (16\pi)^{-1} \delta(R \sqrt{-g}) \, \w{e}$, since obviously $(x^\alpha)$, and thus
$\w{e}$, is not altered by the variation $\delta\w{g}$.
From the expression of $\delta(R\sqrt{-g})$ given by Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:proto_EH})
and using $G_{\mu\nu} \delta g^{\mu\nu} = - G^{\mu\nu} \delta g_{\mu\nu}$,
we get $16\pi\delta\w{L} = - G^{\mu\nu} \delta g_{\mu\nu} \, \weps + \nabla_\mu H^\mu \, \weps$,
where $G^{\mu\nu}$ is the double metric dual of the Einstein tensor and
$\w{H}$ is the vector field defined in terms of $\delta\w{g}$ by Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:def_H}),
where $h^\alpha_{\ \, \beta} = g^{\alpha\mu} \delta  g_{\mu\beta}$
since $h_{\alpha\beta}:= \delta g_{\alpha\beta}$. Now, the identity (\ref{e:bas:dveps_divv})
yields $\nabla_\mu H^\mu \,  \weps = \dd (\w{H}\cdot\weps)$, so that
$16\pi \delta\w{L} = - G^{\mu\nu} \delta g_{\mu\nu} \, \weps +  \dd (\w{H}\cdot\weps)$.
We conclude that the variation of the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian is indeed of the form
(\ref{e:tha:delta_L_E_Theta}) with
\be \label{e:tha:E_Theta_GR}
    E^{\alpha\beta} = - (16\pi)^{-1} \, G^{\alpha\beta}
    \qand
    \w{\theta} =  (16\pi)^{-1} \, \w{H}\cdot\weps = (16\pi)^{-1}\,  \star\!\uu{H} ,
\ee
where the last equality stems from the definition of the Hodge dual
of a 1-form [Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:Hodge_dual}) with $p=1$] ($\uu{H}$ being the 1-form
metric dual of the vector $\w{H}$).
In index notation, $\theta_{\alpha_1\cdots\alpha_{n-1}} = (16\pi)^{-1}  H^\mu \eps_{\mu\alpha_1\cdots\alpha_{n-1}}$.
Substituting Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:def_H}) for $H^\mu$, we get the explicit expression of
$\w{\theta}[\w{g},\delta\w{g}]$:
\be \label{e:tha:Theta_GR}
    \theta_{\alpha_1\cdots\alpha_{n-1}} = (16\pi)^{-1}\, g^{\mu\nu} g^{\rho\sigma}
    \left( \nabla_\sigma \delta g_{\nu\rho} - \nabla_\nu \delta g_{\rho\sigma} \right)
    \epsilon_{\mu\alpha_1\cdots\alpha_{n-1}}  .
\ee
We check that $\w{\theta}[\w{g},\delta\w{g}]$ is linear in $\delta\w{g}$, as stated in Property~\ref{p:tha:var_Lagrangian}.
\end{example}

\begin{prop}[field equations from least action principle]
The action $\mathcal{S}$ defined by (\ref{e:tha:action_L}) is extremal with respect to any
metric tensor variation $\delta\w{g}$ that has compact support if, and only if,
\be \label{e:tha:eom_E}
    \w{E} = 0 .
\ee
This constitutes the so-called \defin{Euler-Lagrange equations}\index{Euler-Lagrange!equation} for the considered gravity theory, also called the \defin{field equations}\index{field!equations} or
\defin{equations of motion}.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Since $\delta\w{g}$ is assumed to have compact support, let $\mathscr{D}$ be
a submanifold with boundary of $\M$ enclosing the support of $\delta\w{g}$, i.e. such that
$\delta\w{g} = 0$ on the boundary $\partial\mathscr{D}$ and outside $\mathscr{D}$.
In view of Eqs.~(\ref{e:tha:action_L}) and (\ref{e:tha:delta_L_E_Theta}), we have then
\[
    \delta \mathcal{S} = \int_\M \delta\w{L} = \int_{\mathscr{D}} E^{\mu\nu} \delta g_{\mu\nu} \, \weps
        + \int_{\mathscr{D}} \dd \w{\theta}
     = \int_{\mathscr{D}} E^{\mu\nu} \delta g_{\mu\nu} \, \weps
        + \underbrace{\int_{\partial\mathscr{D}} \w{\theta}}_{0}
     =  \int_{\mathscr{D}} E^{\mu\nu} \delta g_{\mu\nu} \, \weps ,
\]
where Stokes' theorem (\ref{e:bas:Stokes}) has been used to let appear the integral
of $\w{\theta}$ on $\partial\mathscr{D}$ and this integral has been set to zero due
to the linearity of $\w{\theta}$ in $\delta\w{g}$, given that $\left. \delta\w{g} \right |_{\partial\mathscr{D}} = 0$.
Consequently, having $\delta \mathcal{S} = 0$ for any variation $\delta\w{g}$ is equivalent to
Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:eom_E}).
\end{proof}

\begin{example} \label{x:tha:field_equations_GR}
For general relativity, $\w{E}$ is given by Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:E_Theta_GR}).
Hence the field equations (\ref{e:tha:eom_E}) become $\w{G} = 0$, which
is equivalent to $\w{R}=0$ --- the
vacuum Einstein equation\index{Einstein!equation!vacuum --}\index{vacuum!Einstein equation}
(\ref{e:fra:vac_Einstein}).
\end{example}

\subsection{Noether charges related to diffeomorphism invariance}

Let $\w{\xi}$ be a smooth vector field on $\M$. $\w{\xi}$ generates a family of
infinitesimal diffeomorphisms, namely the flow maps $\Phi_t: \M \to \M$, where
$t$ is an infinitesimal parameter. As described in Sec.~\ref{s:bas:Lie_der_vector}, each $\Phi_t$ displaces any point $p\in\M$ by the infinitesimal vector $t\left.\w{\xi}\right| _p$.
The flow map $\Phi_t$ is clearly a diffeomorphism, whose inverse is $\Phi_t^{-1} = \Phi_{-t}$.
Let us consider a variation $\delta\w{g}$ induced $\Phi_t$,
or more precisely by $\Phi_t^{-1}$ in order to simplify expressions:
choosing $\Phi_t^{-1}$ makes indeed the pullback $\Phi_t^*\w{g}$ appear instead of $(\Phi_t^{-1})^*\w{g}$
(cf. the above discussion). The variation of $\w{g}$ is then
\be \label{e:tha:delta_g_Phistar}
    \delta\w{g} = \Phi_t^* \w{g} - \w{g} .
\ee
Since $t$ is infinitesimal, the very definition of the
Lie derivative [Eq.~(\ref{e:bas:def_Lie_der_covar})] leads to
$\Phi_t^*\w{g} - \w{g} = t \Lie{\xi} \w{g}$.
It follows immediately that
\be  \label{e:bas:delta_g_Lie_xi_g}
    \delta\w{g} = t \Lie{\xi} \w{g} .
\ee
The variation of the Lagrangian $n$-form induced by $\delta\w{g}$
is $\delta\w{L} = \w{L}[\Phi_t^*\w{g}] - \w{L}[\w{g}]$.
Since the theory is assumed to be diffeomorphism-invariant, the covariance property
(\ref{e:tha:covariant_Lagrangian}) holds: $\w{L}[\Phi_t^*\w{g}] = \Phi_t^*\w{L}[\w{g}]$.
This yields $\delta\w{L} = \Phi_t^* \w{L}[\w{g}] - \w{L}[\w{g}]$. This
is the same form as $\w{g}$'s variation expressed in Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:delta_g_Phistar}) and, again, the
definition (\ref{e:bas:def_Lie_der_covar}) of the Lie derivative (which is applicable here since
$\w{L}$ is a tensor field of type $(0,n)$) leads to
\be \label{e:bas:delta_L_Lie_xi_L}
    \delta\w{L} = t \Lie{\xi} \w{L} .
\ee

\begin{remark}
The variation $\delta\w{g}$ is often defined as a \emph{variation rate} rather than a genuine variation, namely
as the \emph{derivative} of a 1-parameter family of metric tensors $\hat{\w{g}}(t)$ such that
$\hat{\w{g}}(0) = \w{g}$. Using the symbol $\hat\delta$ to distinguish from the variation considered here,
the definition is
$\hat{\delta}\w{g} := \left. \D{\hat{\w{g}}}/\D{t} \right|_{t=0}$.
Since the metric family induced by the flow maps along $\w{\xi}$ is
$\hat{\w{g}}(t) := \Phi_t^*\, \w{g}$, one gets
$\hat{\delta}\w{g} = \lim_{t\to 0} t^{-1} \left( \Phi_t^* \w{g} - \w{g} \right)$.
In view of the definition (\ref{e:bas:def_Lie_der_covar}) of the Lie derivative, this yields
\be \label{e:tha:hat_delta_g_Lie}
    \hat{\delta}\w{g} =  \Lie{\xi} \w{g} .
\ee
Similarly, one defines $\hat{\delta}\w{L} :=  \left. \D{\w{L}[\hat{\w{g}}(\lambda)]}/\D{\lambda} \right|_{\lambda=0}$, which yields $\hat{\delta}\w{L} =  \Lie{\xi} \w{L}$.
When comparing with Eqs.~(\ref{e:bas:delta_g_Lie_xi_g}) and(\ref{e:bas:delta_L_Lie_xi_L}), we see that the derivative-based definition has the advantage of getting rid of the (not particularly significant) infinitesimal factor $t$.
\end{remark}

If one plugs Eqs.~(\ref{e:bas:delta_g_Lie_xi_g}) and (\ref{e:bas:delta_L_Lie_xi_L})
into the generic Lagrangian variation formula (\ref{e:tha:delta_L_E_Theta}), one gets
$t \Lie{\xi} \w{L}  = t E^{\mu\nu} \Liec{\xi} g_{\mu\nu} \,\weps + \dd( \w{\theta}[\w{g},t\Lie{\xi}\w{g}])$.
Since $\w{\theta}$ is linear with respect to its second argument (cf. Property~\ref{p:tha:var_Lagrangian}),
one has
$\dd( \w{\theta}[\w{g},t\Lie{\xi}\w{g}]) =  t \dd( \w{\theta}[\w{g},\Lie{\xi}\w{g}])$, so that there comes
\[
    \Lie{\xi} \w{L}  = E^{\mu\nu} \Liec{\xi} g_{\mu\nu} \,\weps + \dd( \w{\theta}[\w{g},\Lie{\xi}\w{g}]) .
\]
Now, the Cartan identity (\ref{e:bas:Cartan}) gives
$\Lie{\xi} \w{L} = \w{\xi} \cdot\dd \w{L} + \dd(\w{\xi}\cdot\w{L}) = \dd(\w{\xi}\cdot\w{L})$
since $\dd \w{L} = 0$, as any $(n+1)$-form on a manifold of dimension $n$.
Hence, we may rewrite the above equation as
\be \label{e:tha:dd_pre_J_E}
    \dd\left(  \w{\theta}[\w{g},\Lie{\xi}\w{g}] - \w{\xi}\cdot\w{L} \right) =
    - E^{\mu\nu} \Liec{\xi} g_{\mu\nu} \,\weps .
\ee
If the field equations are fulfilled, i.e. if $\w{E} = 0$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:eom_E})], the
argument of the exterior derivative in the left-hand side is a closed
$(n-1)$-form. This defines a conserved current and motivates the following definition and property.

\begin{prop}[Noether current form]
\label{p:tha:Noether_current}
Given any smooth vector field $\w{\xi}$ on $\M$,
the \defin{Noether current $(n-1)$-form of $\w{\xi}$}\index{Noether!current form} is defined by \cite{Wald93,IyerW94}
\be \label{e:tha:def_Noether_current}
    \w{J}[\w{\xi}] := \w{\theta}[\w{g},\Lie{\xi}\w{g}] - \w{\xi}\cdot\w{L} ,
\ee
where $\w{\theta}[\w{g},\Lie{\xi}\w{g}]$ is the $(n-1)$-form obtained by setting the second
argument of the symplectic potential form $\w{\theta}[\w{g},\delta\w{g}]$
to $\Lie{\xi}\w{g}$ (cf. Property~\ref{p:tha:var_Lagrangian}).
$\w{J}[\w{\xi}]$ is a linear and local function of $\w{\xi}$. It is a priori not unique,
some ambiguity $\w{J}\mapsto \w{J'}$ resulting from (\ref{e:tha:Theta_not_unique}):
\be \label{e:tha:J_not_unique}
     \w{J'}[\w{\xi}] =  \w{J}[\w{\xi}]  + \dd \w{Y}[\w{g},\Lie{\xi}\w{g}],
\ee
where $\w{Y}[\w{g},\Lie{\xi}\w{g}]$ is any $(n-2)$-form that is linear in $\Lie{\xi}\w{g}$.

If the gravity theory described by the Lagrangian $n$-form $\w{L}$ is diffeomorphism-invariant, then
the differential form $\w{J}[\w{\xi}]$ is closed as soon as the equations of motion (\ref{e:tha:eom_E}) are
satisfied or $\w{\xi}$ is a Killing vector:
\be \label{e:tha:J_closed}
    \dd \w{J}[\w{\xi}]  = 0 .
\ee
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
That $\w{J}[\w{\xi}]$ is a linear function of $\w{\xi}$ follows immediately from
the linearity of $\w{\theta}[.,.]$ with respect to its second argument. Similarly the
locality of $\w{J}[\w{\xi}]$ with respect of $\w{\xi}$ is inherited from
that of $\w{\theta}[.,.]$.
Finally, if the theory diffeomorphism-invariant, Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:dd_pre_J_E}) holds. Given the
definition of $\w{J}[\w{\xi}]$, Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:dd_pre_J_E}) is equivalent to
$\dd\w{J}[\w{\xi}]  = - E^{\mu\nu} \Liec{\xi} g_{\mu\nu} \,\weps$,
so that $\dd\w{J}[\w{\xi}]  = 0$ if $\w{E} = 0$ is fulfilled or $\w{\xi}$ is a Killing vector
($\Lie{\xi}\w{g} = 0$).
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
Let us continue with the example of general relativity. From
expression (\ref{e:tha:Theta_GR}) for $\w{\theta}$ with
$\delta g_{\mu\nu} = t \Liec{\xi} g_{\mu\nu}$ and $\Liec{\xi} g_{\mu\nu} = \nabla_\mu \xi_\nu + \nabla_\nu \xi_\mu$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:bas:Lie_g_Killing})], we get
\bea
 16\pi   \w{\theta}[\w{g},\Lie{\xi}\w{g}]_{\alpha_1\cdots\alpha_{n-1}} & = &
  g^{\mu\nu} \left( \nabla_\sigma \nabla_\nu \xi^\sigma + \nabla_\sigma \nabla^\sigma \xi_\nu
    - 2 \nabla_\nu \nabla_\rho \xi^\rho \right) \epsilon_{\mu\alpha_1\cdots\alpha_{n-1}} \nonumber \\
    & = & g^{\mu\nu} \left( 2 R_{\nu\sigma} \xi^\sigma - \nabla_\sigma \nabla_\nu \xi^\sigma
     + \nabla_\sigma \nabla^\sigma \xi_\nu \right) \epsilon_{\mu\alpha_1\cdots\alpha_{n-1}} \nonumber \\
    & = & \left( 2 R^\mu_{\ \, \nu} \xi^\nu + \nabla_\nu \nabla^\nu \xi^\mu - \nabla_\nu \nabla^\mu \xi^\nu
        \right) \epsilon_{\mu\alpha_1\cdots\alpha_{n-1}} , \nonumber
\eea
where the contracted Ricci identity (\ref{e:bas:contract_Ricci_ident}) has been used to write the second
line. Plugging this formula, as well as $\w{L} = R \weps$ (Example~\ref{x:tha:EH_Lagrangian}) into
the definition (\ref{e:tha:def_Noether_current}) of $\w{J}[\w{\xi}]$ yields
\[
    J[\w{\xi}]_{\alpha_1\cdots\alpha_{n-1}} = (16\pi)^{-1} \left(2 G^\mu_{\ \, \nu} \xi^\nu +
        \nabla_\nu \nabla^\nu \xi^\mu - \nabla_\nu \nabla^\mu \xi^\nu \right) \epsilon_{\mu\alpha_1\cdots\alpha_{n-1}} .
\]
If the field equations are obeyed, then $\w{G}=0$ (Example~\ref{x:tha:field_equations_GR}) and the above
expression reduces to
\be \label{e:tha:J_GR_comp}
    J[\w{\xi}]_{\alpha_1\cdots\alpha_{n-1}} = (16\pi)^{-1} \left(
        \nabla_\nu \nabla^\nu \xi^\mu - \nabla_\nu \nabla^\mu \xi^\nu \right) \epsilon_{\mu\alpha_1\cdots\alpha_{n-1}} .
\ee
We recognize in the term within parentheses the \emph{Komar current of $\w{\xi}$}\index{Komar!current}\index{current!Komar --}  as defined by Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:def_Komar_current}):
$\mathcal{J}[\w{\xi}]^\mu := \nabla_\nu \nabla^\nu \xi^\mu - \nabla_\nu \nabla^\mu \xi^\nu$.
Accordingly, we may write
\be \label{e:tha:J_GR_Komar}
    \w{J}[\w{\xi}] = (16\pi)^{-1}\, \w{\mathcal{J}}[\w{\xi}]  \cdot \weps
    = (16\pi)^{-1} \star\uu{\mathcal{J}}[\w{\xi}]  ,
\ee
where the last equality stems from Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:Hodge_dual}) with $p=1$.
Hence, for general relativity, the Noether current $(n-1)$-form of $\w{\xi}$ is nothing but the
Hodge dual of the (metric dual of) Komar current of $\w{\xi}$, up to the factor
$(16\pi)^{-1}$.
That $\w{J}[\w{\xi}]$ is closed in this case follows readily from the identity (\ref{e:bas:dveps_divv}):
$16\pi \, \dd\w{J}[\w{\xi}] = \dd( \w{\mathcal{J}}[\w{\xi}] \cdot \weps ) = (\wnab\cdot\w{\mathcal{J}}[\w{\xi}]) \weps$, along
with the conservation law (\ref{e:sta:divJ_zero}): $\wnab\cdot\w{\mathcal{J}}[\w{\xi}] = 0$.
\end{example}

\begin{prop}[Noether charge form]
\label{p:tha:Noether_charge_form}
Given a vector field $\w{\xi}$ on $\M$ and a diffeomorphism-invariant theory described by a Lagrangian $n$-form $\w{L}$, there exists a $(n-2)$-form $\w{Q}[\w{\xi}]$ on $\M$,
which is a linear local function of $\w{\xi}$, such that
the Noether current $(n-1)$-form of $\w{\xi}$ is the exterior derivative of $\w{Q}[\w{\xi}]$:
\be \label{e:tha:J_dQ}
    \w{J}[\w{\xi}] = \dd \w{Q}[\w{\xi}] .
\ee
$\w{Q}[\w{\xi}]$ is called the \defin{Noether charge $(n-2)$-form of $\w{\xi}$}\index{Noether!charge!form}
    \cite{Wald93}. It is not unique, being subject to the ambiguity
$\w{Q} \mapsto \w{Q'}$, with
\be \label{e:tha:Q_not_unique}
    \w{Q'}[\w{\xi}] = \w{Q}[\w{\xi}] + \w{Y}[\w{g},\Lie{\xi}\w{g}] + \dd\w{Z}[\w{g},\w{\xi}] ,
\ee
where $\w{Y}[\w{g},\Lie{\xi}\w{g}]$ is any $(n-2)$-form that is linear in $\Lie{\xi}\w{g}$ and
$\w{Z}[\w{g},\w{\xi}] $ is any $(n-3)$-form that is linear in $\w{\xi}$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Since $\w{J}[\w{\xi}]$ is a closed differential form [Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:J_closed})], the Poincaré lemma
states that it is locally exact (on a contractible open set, cf. Sec.~\ref{s:bas:ext_deriv}). However, because
$\dd \w{J}[\w{\xi}]  = 0$ holds for any vector field $\w{\xi}$, it can be shown that
$\w{J}[\w{\xi}]$ is \emph{globally} exact, i.e. takes the form (\ref{e:tha:J_dQ})
with $\w{Q}[\w{\xi}]$ being a local function of $\w{\xi}$ \cite{Wald90}.
Finally, the $\w{Y}$ ambiguity  in (\ref{e:tha:Q_not_unique}) is inherited from the ambiguity of $\w{J}$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:J_not_unique})], while the $\w{Z}$ ambiguity stems from Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:J_dQ}) defining
$\w{Q}$ up to the addition of a closed $(n-2)$-form (cf. Lemma~1 in Ref.~\cite{Wald90}).
\end{proof}


\begin{example}
\label{x:tha:Noether_charge_form_GR}
For general relativity, $\w{J}[\w{\xi}]$ is given by Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:J_GR_comp}), or Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:J_GR_Komar}) in terms of the Komar current of $\w{\xi}$.
The Noether charge $(n-2)$-form is then nothing but minus the Hodge dual of the exterior derivative
of the 1-form $\uu{\xi}$ (the metric dual to $\w{\xi}$), up to the factor $(16\pi)^{-1}$:
\be \label{e:tha:Q_GR_Komar}
    \w{Q}[\w{\xi}] = - (16\pi)^{-1}\, \star (\dd \uu{\xi}) .
\ee
Given the expression of the Hodge dual
of a 2-form [Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:Hodge_dual}) with $p=2$], the identity
$(\dd\uu{\xi})_{\alpha\beta} = \nabla_\alpha  \xi_\beta - \nabla_\beta \xi_\alpha$
[Eq.~(\ref{e:bas:def_ext_1f_nab})] and the antisymmetry of $\weps$, a formula
equivalent to (\ref{e:tha:Q_GR_Komar}) is
\be \label{e:tha:Noether_Q_GR}
    Q[\w{\xi}]_{\alpha_1\cdots\alpha_{n-2}} = -  (16\pi)^{-1}\,  \nabla^\mu \xi^\nu
        \eps_{\mu\nu\alpha_1\cdots\alpha_{n-2}} .
\ee
To prove that $\w{Q}[\w{\xi}]$ as given by (\ref{e:tha:Q_GR_Komar}) obeys
$\dd\w{Q}[\w{\xi}] = \w{J}[\w{\xi}]$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:J_dQ})], let us establish the
Hodge dual of this relation: $\star\dd\w{Q}[\w{\xi}] = \star\w{J}[\w{\xi}]$,
which is an equality between 1-forms. From Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:Q_GR_Komar}), we have
$\star\dd\w{Q}[\w{\xi}] = - (16\pi)^{-1}\,  \star\dd \star (\dd \uu{\xi})$.
Now, the operator $\star\dd\star$ is, up to a sign, the \defin{codifferential}\index{codifferential}
$\w{\delta}$, which maps a $p$-form to a $(p-1)$-form and is defined by\footnote{See e.g. Eq.~(14.35) of Straumann's book \cite{Strau13}, whose sign
convention we follow here. Note that the same letter $\delta$
is used to denote the codifferential and the variation operator; to distinguish between the two,
we are using a boldface symbol for the codifferential.}
$\w{\delta} := (-1)^{n(p+1)+1} \star\dd\star$. Since $\dd \uu{\xi}$ is a 2-form, we get
$\star\dd\w{Q}[\w{\xi}] = (-1)^n (16\pi)^{-1}\, \w{\delta}(\dd \uu{\xi})$. From the expression of the
codifferential in a coordinate chart $(x^\alpha)$ (cf. e.g. Eq.~(14.37) in Ref.~\cite{Strau13}), we may
write, for any 2-form $\w{A}$:
\[
        (\w{\delta}\w{A})^\alpha = \frac{1}{\sqrt{-g}} \der{}{x^\mu} \left(\sqrt{-g} A^{\mu\alpha} \right)
            = - \nabla_\mu A^{\alpha\mu} ,
\]
where the last equality follows from the identity (\ref{e:bas:div_antisym}).
Applying the above formula to $\w{A} := \dd\uu{\xi}$,  we get
$\w{\delta}(\dd\uu{\xi})^\alpha = - \nabla_\mu (\nabla^\alpha \xi^\mu - \nabla^\mu \xi^\alpha) = \mathcal{J}[\w{\xi}]^\alpha$, i.e. $\w{\delta}(\dd\uu{\xi}) = \uu{\mathcal{J}}[\w{\xi}]$,
where $\w{\mathcal{J}}[\w{\xi}]$ is the Komar current of $\w{\xi}$
defined by Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:def_Komar_current}).
Hence $\star\dd\w{Q}[\w{\xi}] = (-1)^n (16\pi)^{-1}\, \uu{\mathcal{J}}[\w{\xi}]$. On the other hand, we have
$\star \w{J}[\w{\xi}] =(16\pi)^{-1}\, \star \star\uu{\mathcal{J}}[\w{\xi}]$ from
Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:J_GR_Komar}). Since $\star\star = (-1)^n \mathrm{Id}$ for a 1-form
(cf. e.g. formula (14.26) in Ref.~\cite{Strau13}), we immediately get
$\star \w{J}[\w{\xi}]  = \star\dd\w{Q}[\w{\xi}]$, which is equivalent to
Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:J_dQ}).
\end{example}


\begin{prop}[Noether charge of a spacelike hypersurface]
\label{p:tha:Noether_charge_hypersurf}
Let us consider a vector field $\w{\xi}$ on $\M$ and a diffeomorphism-invariant theory described by a Lagrangian $n$-form $\w{L}$.
Given a spacelike hypersurface $\Sigma$, the
\defin{Noether charge of $\Sigma$ with respect to $\w{\xi}$}\index{Noether!charge!of a hypersurface} is
\be \label{e:tha:def_Q_hypersurf}
    \mathscr{Q}_{\Sigma,\w{\xi}} := \int_{\Sigma} \w{J}[\w{\xi}] ,
\ee
where $\w{J}[\w{\xi}]$ is the Noether current $(n-1)$-form of $\w{\xi}$ (Property~\ref{p:tha:Noether_current})
and the integral is taken with respect to $\Sigma$ endowed with the \defin{future orientation},
i.e. the orientation defined by $\w{n}\cdot\weps$, where $\w{n}$ is the future-directed timelike unit normal
to $\Sigma$. The Noether charge is a priori not unique, since any change $\w{J} \mapsto \w{J'}$
allowed by (\ref{e:tha:J_not_unique}) leads to $\mathscr{Q}_{\Sigma,\w{\xi}} \mapsto \mathscr{Q'}_{\Sigma,\w{\xi}}$
with
\be \label{e:tha:Q_hyper_not_unique}
    \mathscr{Q'}_{\Sigma,\w{\xi}} = \mathscr{Q}_{\Sigma,\w{\xi}} +
    \int_{\partial\Sigma} \w{Y}[\w{g},\Lie{\xi}\w{g}] ,
\ee
where $\w{Y}[\w{g},\Lie{\xi}\w{g}]$ is any $(n-2)$-form that is linear in $\Lie{\xi}\w{g}$.
However, if $\w{\xi}$ is a Killing vector ($\Lie{\xi}\w{g}=0$), the Noether charge is
uniquely defined: $\w{J'}[\w{\xi}] = \w{J}[\w{\xi}]$ and $\mathscr{Q'}_{\Sigma,\w{\xi}} = \mathscr{Q}_{\Sigma,\w{\xi}}$.

Let $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ be two spacelike hypersurfaces, such that $\Sigma_2$ lies
in the future of $\Sigma_1$ and both hypersurfaces are connected by a hypersurface $\mathscr{W}$, i.e.
$\Sigma_1\cup\Sigma_2\cup\mathscr{W}$ is a closed hypersurface consituting
the boundary of a $n$-dimensional manifold  $\mathscr{D}\subset\M$ (cf. Fig.~??).
Then the following conservation law holds:
\be \label{e:tha:Noether_Q_Sigma_1_2}
    \encadre{ \mathscr{Q}_{\Sigma_2,\w{\xi}}  = \mathscr{Q}_{\Sigma_1,\w{\xi}}
    + \int_{\mathscr{W}^{\swarrow}} \w{J}[\w{\xi}] },
\ee
where the integral over $\mathscr{W}$ is taken with respect to the \emph{inward} orientation (indicated by
the arrow), i.e. the orientation
defined by $\w{v}\cdot\weps$, where $\w{v}$ is any vector field pointing into $\mathscr{D}$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Equation~(\ref{e:tha:Q_hyper_not_unique}) readily follows from (\ref{e:tha:J_not_unique}) and
Stokes' theorem (\ref{e:bas:Stokes}). If $\w{\xi}$ is a Killing vector, then
$\Lie{\xi}\w{g}= 0$ by definition (cf. Property~\ref{p:def_Killing_vector}); this implies
$\w{Y}[\w{g},\Lie{\xi}\w{g}] = 0$ in the
right-hand side of Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:Q_hyper_not_unique}), given that
$\w{Y}$ must be linear in its second argument. Hence
$\mathscr{Q'}_{\Sigma,\w{\xi}} = \mathscr{Q}_{\Sigma,\w{\xi}}$.
As for Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:Noether_Q_Sigma_1_2}),
given that $\partial\mathscr{D} = \Sigma_1\cup\Sigma_2\cup\mathscr{W}$, Stokes' theorem (\ref{e:bas:Stokes})
along with $\dd \w{J}[\w{\xi}] = 0$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:J_closed})] yields
\[
     \int_{\Sigma_1^{\nearrow}} \w{J}[\w{\xi}] + \int_{\Sigma_2^{\nearrow}} \w{J}[\w{\xi}]
      + \int_{\mathscr{W}^{\nearrow}} \w{J}[\w{\xi}] = 0 ,
\]
where the arrows mean that $\Sigma_1$, $\Sigma_2$ and $\mathscr{W}$ are oriented according to the outward
convention (with respect to $\mathscr{D}$).
Noticing that $\int_{\Sigma_1^{\nearrow}} \w{J}[\w{\xi}] = -\mathscr{Q}_{\Sigma_1,\w{\xi}}$,
$\int_{\Sigma_2^{\nearrow}} \w{J}[\w{\xi}] = \mathscr{Q}_{\Sigma_1,\w{\xi}}$
and $\int_{\mathscr{W}^{\nearrow}} \w{J}[\w{\xi}] = - \int_{\mathscr{W}^{\swarrow}} \w{J}[\w{\xi}]$
yields (\ref{e:tha:Noether_Q_Sigma_1_2}).
\end{proof}

The integral over $\mathscr{W}$ in Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:Noether_Q_Sigma_1_2}) can be interpreted an
an ``inward flux'' integral, especially if $\mathscr{W}$ is a timelike hypersurface
(cf. the electromagnetic analogy detailed in Remark~\ref{r:tha:charge_em_analogy} below).
If this flux integral vanishes,
Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:Noether_Q_Sigma_1_2}) expresses the
invariance of the Noether charge with respect to the choice of the hypersurface
(conservation during ``time evolution''). This occurs
if $\w{J}[\w{\xi}] = 0$ on $\mathscr{W}$ or if  $\mathscr{W}$ is at some asymptotically flat end
of $\M$ with $\w{J}[\w{\xi}]$ decaying sufficiently fast so that its integral on $\mathscr{W}$ is zero.

\begin{prop}[Noether charge of a spacelike $(n-2)$-surface]
\label{p:tha:Noether_charge_surf}
Let us consider a vector field $\w{\xi}$ on $\M$ and a diffeomorphism-invariant theory described by a Lagrangian $n$-form $\w{L}$.
Let assume further that $(\M,\w{g})$ is asymptotically flat.
Given a closed $(n-2)$-surface $\Sp\subset\M$, the
\defin{Noether charge of $\Sp$ with respect to $\w{\xi}$}\index{Noether!charge!of a surface} is
\be \label{e:tha:def_Noether_Q_surf}
    \mathscr{Q}_{\Sp,\w{\xi}} := \int_{\Sp} \w{Q}[\w{\xi}] ,
\ee
where $\w{Q}[\w{\xi}]$ is the Noether charge $(n-2)$-form of $\w{\xi}$
(Property~\ref{p:tha:Noether_charge_form}) and the orientation of $\Sp$ for the above integral is the \emph{future-outward} orientation
defined by Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:def_weps_S}).
The Noether charge is a priori not unique, since any change $\w{Q} \mapsto \w{Q'}$
obeying (\ref{e:tha:Q_not_unique}) leads to $\mathscr{Q}_{\Sp,\w{\xi}} \mapsto \mathscr{Q'}_{\Sp,\w{\xi}}$
with
\be \label{e:tha:Q_surf_not_unique}
    \mathscr{Q'}_{\Sp,\w{\xi}} = \mathscr{Q}_{\Sp,\w{\xi}} + \int_{\Sp} \w{Y}[\w{g},\Lie{\xi}\w{g}] ,
\ee
where $\w{Y}[\w{g},\Lie{\xi}\w{g}]$ is any $(n-2)$-form that is linear in $\Lie{\xi}\w{g}$.
However, if $\w{\xi}$ is a Killing vector ($\Lie{\xi}\w{g}=0$), the Noether charge is
uniquely defined: $\mathscr{Q'}_{\Sp,\w{\xi}} = \mathscr{Q}_{\Sp,\w{\xi}}$.

Let $\Sigma$ be a compact spacelike hypersurface bounded by two closed $(n-2)$-surfaces:
an ``internal'' one, $\Sp_{\rm int}$, and an ``external'' one,
$\Sp_{\rm ext}$, the exterior direction being that of the asymptotic flat end of $(\M, \w{g})$.
Then
\be \label{e:tha:Noether_Q_S_ext_int}
     \encadre{ \mathscr{Q}_{\Sp_{\rm ext},\w{\xi}} = \mathscr{Q}_{\Sp_{\rm int},\w{\xi}}
        + \mathscr{Q}_{\Sigma,\w{\xi}}  }.
\ee
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Equation~(\ref{e:tha:Q_surf_not_unique}) readily follows from (\ref{e:tha:Q_not_unique})
along with $\int_{\Sp} \dd\w{Z} = 0$ as a result of Stokes' theorem (\ref{e:bas:Stokes}),
given that $\Sp$ is a closed manifold:
$\partial\Sp = \varnothing$.
If $\w{\xi}$ is a Killing vector, then
$\w{Y}[\w{g},\Lie{\xi}\w{g}] = 0$ in the right-hand side of (\ref{e:tha:Q_surf_not_unique}), thanks to the linearity of $\w{Y}$ with respect to its
second argument; hence $\mathscr{Q'}_{\Sp,\w{\xi}} = \mathscr{Q}_{\Sp,\w{\xi}}$.
Finally, to prove (\ref{e:tha:Noether_Q_S_ext_int}),
let us substitute $\dd\w{Q}$ for $\w{J}$ [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:J_dQ})]
in expression (\ref{e:tha:def_Q_hypersurf}) of
$\mathscr{Q}_{\Sigma,\w{\xi}}$. Applying
Stokes' theorem (\ref{e:bas:Stokes}) and using
$\partial\Sigma = \Sp_{\rm int} \cup \Sp_{\rm ext}$, we get
\[
    \mathscr{Q}_{\Sigma,\w{\xi}} = \int_{\Sp_{\rm int}^\nearrow} \w{Q}[\w{\xi}]
    + \int_{\Sp_{\rm ext}^\nearrow} \w{Q}[\w{\xi}] ,
\]
where the arrows indicate that $\Sp_{\rm int}$ and  $\Sp_{\rm ext}$
are outward-oriented with respect to $\Sigma$ (which is itself future-oriented).
Noticing that $\int_{\Sp_{\rm int}^\nearrow} \w{Q}[\w{\xi}] = - \mathscr{Q}_{\Sp_{\rm int},\w{\xi}}$
and $\int_{\Sp_{\rm ext}^\nearrow} \w{Q}[\w{\xi}] = \mathscr{Q}_{\Sp_{\rm ext},\w{\xi}}$
yields (\ref{e:tha:Noether_Q_S_ext_int}).
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
We are using the same letter $\mathscr{Q}$ to denote the Noether charge of a hypersurface
(Property~\ref{p:tha:Noether_charge_hypersurf}) and the Noether charge of
a $(n-2)$-surface (Property~\ref{p:tha:Noether_charge_surf}). The distinction between the two quantities
occurs only through the index: $\mathscr{Q}_{\Sigma,\w{\xi}}$ versus $\mathscr{Q}_{\Sp,\w{\xi}}$.
This common notation is justified in so far as both quantities are strongly related by
Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:Noether_Q_S_ext_int}). In particular, if the hyprsurface $\Sigma$ has
a single (external) boundary $\Sp$, i.e. $\Sp_{\rm int} = \varnothing$, Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:Noether_Q_S_ext_int}) reduces to
$\mathscr{Q}_{\Sp,\w{\xi}} = \mathscr{Q}_{\Sigma,\w{\xi}}$.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
\label{r:tha:charge_em_analogy}
The name \emph{charge} in the expression \emph{Noether charge} comes of course from the analogy
with electromagnetism: considering $n=4$ for simplicity, the analog of the Noether current 3-form $\w{J}$ is the Hodge dual of the 1-form $\uu{j}$, metric dual of the electric 4-current $\w{j}$:
$\w{J} = \star\uu{j}$, while the analog of the Noether charge 2-form $\w{Q}$ is the Hodge dual
of the electromagnetic field tensor $\w{F}$ divided by $\mu_0$: $\w{Q} =\mu_0^{-1}\star\!\w{F}$. The relation
$\dd \w{Q} = \w{J}$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:J_dQ})] is then nothing but the Maxwell
equation\index{Maxwell equations} (\ref{e:fra:Maxwell_forms}): $\dd\star\!\w{F} = \mu_0 \star\!\uu{j}$.
Then $\mathscr{Q}_{\Sigma,\w{\xi}}$ is the total electric charge within the volume $\Sigma$
(cf. e.g. Eq.~(18.2) in Ref.~\cite{Gourg13}) and $\mathscr{Q}_{\Sp,\w{\xi}}$ is $\mu_0^{-1}$ times the flux of the electromagnetic
field through the surface $\Sp$. Accordingly,
Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:Noether_Q_Sigma_1_2}) expresses the \emph{conservation of electric charge}
and Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:Noether_Q_S_ext_int})
with $\Sp_{\rm int} = \varnothing$ is nothing but \emph{Gauss's law}\index{Gauss's law} (cf. e.g. Eq.~(18.40) in Ref.~\cite{Gourg13}).
\end{remark}

From Example~\ref{x:tha:Noether_charge_form_GR},
we note that the $(n-2)$-form $\star (\dd \uu{\xi})$ giving $\w{Q}[\w{\xi}]$
for general relativity [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:Q_GR_Komar})]
is exactly the differential form that constitutes the integrand in
formula (\ref{e:sta:def_Komar_mass}) defining the Komar mass or in formula
(\ref{e:sta:def_Komar_J}) defining the Komar angular momentum ($\w{\xi} := \w{\eta}$ in that case).
In view of the definition (\ref{e:tha:def_Noether_Q_surf}) of the Noether charge, we conclude that

\begin{prop}[Komar mass and angular momentum as Noether charges]
\label{p:tha:Komar_Noether}
In a stationary spacetime governed by general relativity, the Komar mass\index{Komar!mass}\index{mass!Komar --} over a $(n-2)$-dimensional closed spacelike surface $\Sp$
[Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:def_Komar_mass})]
is, up to a constant factor,
the Noether charge\footnote{The Noether charge is uniquely defined in the present case, since
$\w{\xi}$ is a Killing vector, cf. Property~\ref{p:tha:Noether_charge_surf}.}
of $\Sp$ with respect to the stationary Killing vector $\w{\xi}$.
Similarly, in an axisymmetric spacetime governed by general relativity,
the Komar angular momentum\index{Komar!angular momentum}\index{angular!momentum!Komar --} over $\Sp$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:def_Komar_J})] is, up to a constant factor,
the Noether charge of $\Sp$ with respect to the axisymmetric Killing vector $\w{\eta}$.
\end{prop}

\subsection{Wald entropy}

Having introduced the concept of Noether charge related to diffeomorphism invariance,
we are in position to define the Wald entropy of a stationary black hole.

\begin{prop}[Wald entropy as a Noether charge]
Let $(\M,\w{g})$ be a stationary spacetime of dimension $n\geq 3$ governed
by a diffeomorphism-invariant theory and containing a black hole, whose
event horizon $\Hor$ is a Killing horizon. Let $\w{\chi}$ be the Killing
vector generating $\Hor$ and $\kappa$ the corresponding surface gravity:
$\wnab_{\w{\chi}}\w{\chi} \equalH \kappa \w{\chi}$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:xi_nab_xi_kappa})].
Let us assume that the zeroth law holds, i.e. that $\kappa$ is constant over $\Hor$
(cf. Property~\ref{p:tha:zeroth_law}). Moreover,  let us assume $\kappa \neq 0$.
Let $\Sp$ be a complete cross-section of $\Hor$.
The \defin{Wald entropy}\index{Wald entropy}\index{entropy!Wald --} of the black hole is
then defined as $\kappa^{-1}$ times
the Noether charge of $\Sp$ with respect to $\w{\chi}$,
up to the constant $2\pi k_{\rm B}/\hbar$:
\be \label{e:tha:def_Wald_entropy}
    \encadre{ S_{\rm W} := \frac{2 \pi k_{\rm B}}{\hbar\kappa} \, \mathcal{Q}_{\Sp,\w{\chi}}
    = \frac{2 \pi k_{\rm B}}{\hbar\kappa}  \int_{\Sp} \w{Q}[\w{\chi}] } ,
\ee
where $\w{Q}[\w{\chi}]$ is the Noether charge $(n-2)$-form of $\w{\chi}$,
as defined in Property~\ref{p:tha:Noether_charge_form}.
Since $\w{\chi}$ is a Killing vector, $\mathcal{Q}_{\Sp,\w{\chi}}$ does not suffer from
the ambiguity (\ref{e:tha:Q_surf_not_unique}), so that $S_{\rm W}$ is uniquely defined.
Moreover, $S_{\rm W}$ is independent of the choice of the cross-section $\Sp$ of $\Hor$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Let us consider another complete cross-section $\Sp'$ of $\Hor$ lying entirely in the future of $\Hor$.
Then $\Sp\cup\Sp'$ can be considered as the boundary of a part of $\Hor$, that we shall denote by
$\Delta\Hor$. Stokes' theorem (\ref{e:bas:Stokes}) and the identity
$\dd \w{Q}[\w{\chi}] = \w{J}[\w{\chi}]$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:J_dQ})] gives
\be \label{e:tha:start_proof_Wald_entr}
    \int_{\Sp^\nearrow} \w{Q}[\w{\chi}] +  \int_{{\Sp'}^\nearrow} \w{Q}[\w{\chi}]
    = \int_{\Delta\Hor} \w{J}[\w{\chi}] ,
\ee
where the arrows indicate that $\Sp$ and  $\Sp'$
are outward-oriented with respect to $\Delta\Hor$, the orientation of the latter
being set by a future-directed null vector field $\w{k}$ transverse to $\Hor$.
From the definition (\ref{e:tha:def_Noether_current}),
$\w{J}[\w{\chi}] := \w{\theta}[\w{g},\Lie{\chi}\w{g}] - \w{\chi}\cdot\w{L}
= - \w{\chi}\cdot\w{L}$, since $\Lie{\chi}\w{g}=0$ ($\w{\chi}$ Killing)
along with the linearity of $\w{\theta}$ imply $\w{\theta}[\w{g},\Lie{\chi}\w{g}] =0$.
From the very definition of the integral of a $(n-1)$-form over a $(n-1)$-dimensional
manifold, we have then
\[
    \int_{\Delta\Hor} \w{J}[\w{\chi}] = - \int_{\Delta\Hor} \w{\chi}\cdot\w{L} = - \int_{\Delta\Hor} \w{L}(\w{\chi},\D\w{x}_1,\ldots,
    \D\w{x}_{n-1}) ,
\]
where $\D\w{x}_1$, $\ldots$, $\D\w{x}_{n-1}$ are infinitesimal displacement vectors on $\Delta\Hor$
forming a mesh of it. Now, since $\w{\chi}$ is tangent to $\Delta\Hor$ and $\w{L}$ is a
$n$-form, we have necessarily $\w{L}(\w{\chi},\D\w{x}_1,\ldots,\D\w{x}_{n-1})=0$.
Accordingly, the integral of $\w{J}[\w{\chi}]$ in the right-hand side of Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:start_proof_Wald_entr}) is zero. Given that
$ \int_{\Sp^\nearrow} \w{Q}[\w{\chi}] = -  \mathcal{Q}_{\Sp,\w{\chi}}$ and
$ \int_{{\Sp'}^\nearrow} \w{Q}[\w{\chi}] =  \mathcal{Q}_{\Sp',\w{\chi}}$,
it follows that $\mathcal{Q}_{\Sp',\w{\chi}} = \mathcal{Q}_{\Sp,\w{\chi}}$,
which shows that $S_{\rm W}$ does not depend on the choice of $\Sp$.
\end{proof}


If the considered diffeomorphism-invariant theory is general relativity,
the Wald entropy coincides with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy:

\begin{prop}[Wald entropy for general relativity]
\label{p:tha:Wald_S_for_GR}
For general relativity, the Wald entropy of a stationary black hole
is its Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, as given by formula (\ref{e:tha:S_BH}):
\be \label{e:tha:S_W_S_BH_GR}
    S_{\rm W} = S_{\rm BH} = k_{\rm B}\frac{A}{4\hbar} \quad\mbox{(general relativity)}

$A$ being the black hole area.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
For general relativity, the Noether charge $(n-2)$-form is given by Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:Q_GR_Komar}):
$\w{Q}[\w{\chi}] = - (16\pi)^{-1}\, \star (\dd \uu{\chi})$. We have then
\[
   16\pi  \mathcal{Q}_{\Sp,\w{\chi}} = - \int_{\Sp}  \star (\dd \uu{\chi})
    = - \frac{1}{2} \int_{\Sp} (\dd\w{\chi})_{\mu\nu} \, \D S^{\mu\nu}
    = - \int_{\Sp} \nabla_\mu \chi_\nu  \, \D S^{\mu\nu} ,
\]
where the second equality follows from Lemma~\ref{p:sta:flux_integ_2form}
and the third one from expression (\ref{e:bas:def_ext_1f_nab}) of the exterior
derivative and the antisymmetric character of $\D S^{\mu\nu}$.
Now, from Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:nab_chi_DS}),
$\nabla_\mu \chi_\nu  \, \D S^{\mu\nu} = -2 \kappa \, \D S$,
where $\D S := \sqrt{q}\, \D^{n-2} x$ is the area element of $\Sp$. Since $\kappa$
is constant, there comes $\mathcal{Q}_{\Sp,\w{\chi}}  = \kappa A/(8\pi)$.
In view of the definition (\ref{e:tha:def_Wald_entropy}) of $S_{\rm W}$,
this establishes (\ref{e:tha:S_W_S_BH_GR}).
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}[Explicit expression of the Wald entropy]
Let us consider a stationary black hole in diffeomorphism-invariant theory,
whose Lagrangian scalar $L$ is recast as
(\ref{e:tha:Lagrangian_diffeo_inv}). Assuming that the black hole event
horizon is part of a bifurcate Killing horizon, with bifurcation surface ${\hat \Sp}$,
the Wald entropy is expressible as
\be \label{e:tha:S_Wald_explicit}
    \encadre{ S_{\rm W} = - 2\pi \frac{k_{\rm B}}{\hbar} \int_{\hat{\Sp}} \frac{\delta L}{\delta R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}}
        \; {}^{\hat{\Sp}}\!\!\eps^\perp_{\rho\sigma}\,  \D S_{\mu\nu} },
\ee
where
\begin{itemize}
\item ${\delta L}/{\delta R_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}}$ stands for the type-$(4,0)$ tensor field that is the \defin{Euler-Lagrange derivative}\index{Euler-Lagrange!derivative}
of $L$ with respect to $R_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}$, if the latter were considered as a field independent
of $g_{\alpha\beta}$ in expression~(\ref{e:tha:Lagrangian_diffeo_inv}) of $L$:
\be
    \frac{\delta L}{\delta R_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}} := \der{L}{R_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}}
        - \nabla_\mu  \der{L}{\nabla_\mu R_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}}
        + \nabla_{(\mu} \nabla_{\nu)} \der{L}{\nabla_{(\mu} \nabla_{\nu)} R_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}}
        - \cdots
\ee
\item $\D S_{\alpha\beta}$ is the metric dual of the area element normal bivector
$\D S^{\alpha\beta}$ to $\hat{\Sp}$, as defined by Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:area_bivector});
\item ${}^{\hat{\Sp}}\!\!\weps^\perp$ is the \defin{binormal 2-form}\index{binormal 2-form}
to $\hat{\Sp}$, i.e. for each point $p\in\hat{\Sp}$,
${}^{\hat{\Sp}}\!\!\weps^\perp | _p$ is
the volume 2-form of the metric induced by $\w{g}$ in
the vector space $T_p^\perp  \hat{\Sp}$ normal to $\hat{\Sp}$ equipped with the
future-outward orientation\footnote{See item (iv)
on p.~\pageref{e:sta:def_weps_S} for details.}; ${}^{\hat{\Sp}}\!\!\weps^\perp$ can be expressed
as the exterior product $\uu{s} \wedge \uu{n}$ of
any pair of vector fields $(\w{n},\w{s})$ along  $\hat{\Sp}$ forming
an orthonormal basis of $T_p^\perp  \hat{\Sp}$ at each $p\in\hat{\Sp}$,
with $\w{n}$ future-directed unit timelike and $\w{s}$ outward-directed unit spacelike:
\be \label{e:tha:eps_perp_s_wedge_n}
    {}^{\hat{\Sp}}\!\!\weps^\perp = \uu{s} \wedge \uu{n} \quad \iff \quad
    {}^{\hat{\Sp}}\!\!\eps^\perp_{\alpha\beta} = s_\alpha n_\beta
        - n_\alpha s_\beta .
\ee
\end{itemize}
Note that Eqs.~(\ref{e:sta:area_bivector}) and (\ref{e:tha:eps_perp_s_wedge_n})
establish the following relation between
the area element normal bivector $\D\w{S}$ and
the binormal 2-form ${}^{\hat{\Sp}}\!\!\weps^\perp$:
\be \label{e:tha:DS_eps_perp}
    \D S_{\alpha\beta} = {}^{\hat{\Sp}}\!\!\eps^\perp_{\alpha\beta} \; \D S ,
\ee
where $\D S =  \sqrt{q}\, \D^{n-2} x$ is the area element of $\hat{\Sp}$.
\end{prop}
We refer to Ref.~\cite{IyerW94} for the proof.
Here, we shall just check that formula~(\ref{e:tha:S_Wald_explicit}) yields the
correct value for general relativity:

\begin{example}
For general relativity,  $L = (16\pi)^{-1} g^{\mu\nu} g^{\rho\sigma} R_{\rho\mu\sigma\nu}$
(cf. Example~\ref{x:tha:EH_Lagrangian}), so that
\[
    \frac{\delta L}{\delta R_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}} = \der{L}{R_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}}
    = \frac{1}{16\pi} g^{\alpha\gamma} g^{\beta\delta} .
\]
Accordingly, formula~(\ref{e:tha:S_Wald_explicit}), combined with Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:DS_eps_perp}), yields
\[
    \frac{\hbar}{k_{\rm  B}} \, S_{\rm W}  = -\frac{1}{8} \int_{\hat{\Sp}} g^{\mu\rho} g^{\nu\sigma} \,
    {}^{\hat{\Sp}}\!\!\eps^\perp_{\rho\sigma} \, {}^{\hat{\Sp}}\!\!\eps^\perp_{\mu\nu} \,
    \D S
    = - \frac{1}{8} \int_{\hat{\Sp}}
    \underbrace{({}^{\hat{\Sp}}\!\!\eps^\perp)^{\mu\nu} \, {}^{\hat{\Sp}}\!\!\eps^\perp_{\mu\nu}}_{-2} \,  \D S
    = \frac{1}{4} \int_{\hat{\Sp}} \D S  = \frac{A}{4} ,
\]
where $A$ is the area of $\hat{\Sp}$ and $({}^{\hat{\Sp}}\!\!\eps^\perp)^{\mu\nu} \, {}^{\hat{\Sp}}\!\!\eps^\perp_{\mu\nu}=-2$
follows immediately from Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:eps_perp_s_wedge_n}) along with
$n_\mu n^\mu = -1$, $n_\mu s^\mu = 0$ and $s_\mu s^\mu = 1$.
Hence we recover formula~(\ref{e:tha:S_W_S_BH_GR}) --- the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.
\end{example}

Of course, being defined by a formula that reduces to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy
for general relativity (cf. Property~\ref{p:tha:Wald_S_for_GR})
is not sufficient by itself to assert that the Wald entropy
is the correct concept of entropy for all theories
of gravity. This holds because the Wald entropy naturally enters in the
generalization of the first law to all diffeomorphism-invariant theories
that admit a Hamiltonian formulation, to which we turn now.

\subsection{The covariant phase space approach}

The extension of the first law beyond general relativity has been achieved
by Wald in 1993 \cite{Wald93}, within a Hamiltonian
framework based on the co-called \emph{covariant phase space}\index{covariant!phase space} approach. The Hamiltonian formalism naturally provides the concept
of total mass $M$ --- the variation of which constitutes the left-hand side of the first law --- as the \emph{canonical energy} of the system (value of the Hamiltonian),
thereby generalizing the concept of ADM mass\index{ADM!mass} beyond general relativity.
The \emph{covariant phase space} formalism is a Hamiltonian formulation that
is adapted to field theories, perserving general covariance.
On the contrary, the standard approach relies on the choice of
a time function $t$, with respect to which the evolution is governed by
Hamilton's equations.
For a system with $N$ degrees of freedom,
described by some configuration coordinates $(q^i)_{1\leq i \leq N}$
and a Lagrangian $L = L(q^i,{\dot q}^i)$ (with ${\dot q}^i := \D q^i/\D t$),
\defin{Hamilton's equations}\index{Hamilton's equations} read
${\dot q}^i = \dert{H}{p_i}$ and ${\dot p}_i = - \dert{H}{q^i}$, or equivalently,
\be \label{e:evo_Hamilton_eqs_finite}
    \derd{q^i}{t} = \{q^i, H \} \qand \derd{p_i}{t} = \{p_i, H\} , \quad 1 \leq i \leq N,
\ee
where
the $p_i$'s are the conjugate momenta (i.e. $p_i := \dert{L}{{\dot q}^i}$),
$H$ is the system's Hamiltonian ($H = \sum_{i=1}^N p_i {\dot q}^i - L$)
and $\{.,.\}$
stands for the \defin{Poisson bracket}\index{Poisson!bracket}:
\be \label{e:tha:Poisson_bracket_canon}
 \{f,g\} := \sum_{i=1}^N \left( \der{f}{q^i} \, \der{g}{p_i} - \der{g}{q^i} \, \der{f}{p_i} \right) .
\ee
More generally, for any scalar function $f=f(q^i,p_i)$, one has
\be \label{e:tha:dfdt_Poisson_fH}
     \derd{f}{t} = \{f, H \} .
\ee
The coordinates $(y^a) := (q^1,\ldots,q^N,p_1,\ldots,p_N)$ span a manifold $\FF$ of dimension
$2N$ called the system's \defin{phase space}\index{phase space}.
The Poisson bracket can be rewritten covariantly (i.e. in a form independent of the
coordinates $(y^a)$) by introducing the following 2-form on $\FF$:
\be \label{e:tha:def_symplectic_finite}
    \Omega := \sum_{i=1}^N \Dd p_i \wedge \Dd q^i ,
\ee
where $\Dd$ stands for the exterior derivative\footnote{On phase space manifolds, we are
not using boldface notations for operators and tensor fields, keeping them for the spacetime
manifold only. Hence the exterior derivative on $\FF$ is denoted by $\Dd$, and not
$\dd$, as defined in Sec.~\ref{s:bas:ext_deriv}, the 2-form (\ref{e:tha:def_symplectic_finite}) is denoted $\Omega$ and not $\w{\Omega}$, etc.}
 on $\FF$,
so that $\Dd p_i$ (resp. $\Dd q^i$) is the differential 1-form of $p_i$
(resp. $q^i$) considered as a scalar field on $\FF$.
Given that $q^i = y^i$ and $p_i = y^{i+N}$,
the components of $\Omega$ with respect to the coordinates
$(y^a)$ are $\Omega_{ab} =  \sum_{i=1}^N \left( \delta^{i+N}_a \delta^i_b - \delta^i_a \delta^{i+N}_b\right) = \delta_{a,b+N} - \delta_{b,a+N}$. Hence, we may write,
using block matrix notation,
\be \label{e:tha:Omega_ab}
    \Omega_{ab} = \begin{pmatrix}
                    0 & - I_N \\
                    I_N & 0
                  \end{pmatrix} ,
\ee
where $a$ and $b$ are respectively the row and column indices
and $I_N$ stands for the identity matrix of size $N$.
Any coordinate system on $\FF$ in which the 2-form $\Omega$
is expressible as (\ref{e:tha:def_symplectic_finite}), or equivalenty,
in which the components of $\Omega$ are the matrix (\ref{e:tha:Omega_ab}),
is called a system of \defin{canonical coordinates}\index{canonical!coordinates}\index{coordinate!canonical --}.
The matrix $(\Omega_{ab})$
is clearly invertible, its inverse being its opposite:
\be \label{e:tha:inv_Omega_ab}
    (\Omega^{-1})^{ab} = \begin{pmatrix}
                    0 & I_N \\
                    - I_N & 0
                  \end{pmatrix} .
\ee
This implies that the 2-form $\Omega$ is non-degenerate and allows one
to define an antisymmetric type-$(2,0)$ tensor field on $\FF$,
called the \defin{Poisson bivector}\index{Poisson!bivector}\index{bivector!Poisson --},
by
\be
    \Omega^{-1} = (\Omega^{-1})^{ab}\,  \partial_a \otimes\partial_b .
\ee
As a tensor of type $(2,0)$, $\Omega^{-1}$ acts bilinearly on 1-forms (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:bas:tensors}) and one may define the \defin{Poisson bracket} of two
scalar fields $f$ and $g$ on $\FF$ by letting $\Omega^{-1}$ act on
the pair of 1-forms $(\Dd f, \Dd g)$:
\be \label{e:tha:Poisson_bracket}
   \encadre{ \{f,g\} := \Omega^{-1}(\Dd f, \Dd g) }.
\ee
Given the components (\ref{e:tha:inv_Omega_ab}) of $\Omega^{-1}$ in canonical
coordinates, it is easy to check that this definition reduces to
(\ref{e:tha:Poisson_bracket_canon}) for these type of coordinates.

Because $\Dd  \Dd =  0$ (nilpotence of the exterior derivative, cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:ext_der_nilpot})), it follows immediately from expression (\ref{e:tha:def_symplectic_finite}) that the 2-form $\Omega$ is closed:
$\Dd \Omega = 0$.
This is also obvious from the coordinate expression (\ref{e:bas:def_ext_2f})
of the exterior derivative, given that the components $\Omega_{ab}$
are constant in canonical coordinates [Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:Omega_ab})].
Generically, a closed non-degenerate 2-form $\Omega$ on a smooth manifold $\FF$
is called a \defin{symplectic form}\index{symplectic!form}
and the pair $(\FF,\Omega)$ is called a \defin{symplectic manifold}\index{symplectic!manifold}\index{manifold!symplectic --} (see e.g. Chap.~22 of Lee's textbook \cite{Lee13}).
Not only $\Omega$ is closed, but it is exact. Indeed, it
follows from expression (\ref{e:tha:def_symplectic_finite}) that
\be \label{e:tha:Omega_dTheta}
    \Omega = \Dd \Theta,
\ee
where $\Theta$ is the 1-form defined by
\be \label{e:tha:Theta_pdq}
    \Theta := \sum_{i=1}^N  p_i\,  \Dd q^i .
\ee
Because of (\ref{e:tha:Omega_dTheta}), the 1-form $\Theta$ is called the
\defin{symplectic potential}\index{symplectic!potential}.
It is also called the
\defin{canonical 1-form}\index{canonical!1-form} on $\FF$, because its expression
(\ref{e:tha:Theta_pdq}) is independent of the choice of the
canonical coordinates $(q^i,p_i)$.


To any scalar field $f$ on $\FF$, one associates a unique vector
field $X_f$ on $\FF$ via the Poisson bivector:
\be \label{e:tha:def_X_f}
    \encadre{X_f := \Omega^{-1}(., \Dd f) }.
\ee
Specifically, for any 1-form $\sigma$ on $\FF$, one has
\be
    \langle \sigma, X_f \rangle = X_f(\sigma) = \Omega^{-1}(\sigma, \Dd f) .
\ee
It follows that the components of $X_f$ with respect to
any coordinate system $(y^a)$ are
\be \label{e:tha:X_f_comp}
    X_f^a =  \left( \Omega^{-1} \right)^{ab} \der{f}{y^b} .
\ee
In particular, for canonical coordinates $(y^a) = (q^i, p_i)$, Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:inv_Omega_ab})
leads to
\be \label{e:tha:X_f_canonical}
    X_f = \der{f}{p_i} \, \partial_{q^i} - \der{f}{q^i} \, \partial_{p_i} .
\ee
As a vector field, $X_f$ is a derivative operator on scalar fields [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:bas:v_f_partial_f})], which we may
express in terms of the Poisson bracket by combining Eqs.~(\ref{e:tha:def_X_f}) and (\ref{e:tha:Poisson_bracket}):
\be \label{e:tha:Xf_Poisson_f}
    \encadre{ X_f = \{., f\} },
\ee
the above identity meaning that for any scalar field $g$, $X_f(g) = \{g,f\}$,
with $X_f(g) = X_f^a \partial_a g$.

Formula~(\ref{e:tha:def_X_f}) can be inverted to
\be \label{e:tha:Df_Omega_X_f}
    \encadre{\Dd f = \Omega(., X_f)} .
\ee
\begin{proof}
$\Omega(., X_f)$ is a 1-form whose components
are  $\Omega_{ab} X_f^b$. Thanks to Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:X_f_comp}), we get
$\Omega_{ab} X_f^b = \Omega_{ab}(\Omega^{-1})^{bc}\partial_c f
= \delta^c_{\ \, a} \partial_c f = \partial_a f$, which proves (\ref{e:tha:Df_Omega_X_f}).
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
The vector field $X_f$ and the 1-form $\Dd f$ can be considered as being dual to each other
through the symplectic form $\Omega$ in the very same way as vector fields and 1-forms are dual
through the metric tensor $\w{g}$ on pseudo-Riemannian manifolds: compare formula
(\ref{e:tha:Df_Omega_X_f}) with (\ref{e:bas:underbar}) (rewritten in
as $\uu{u} = \w{g}(.,\w{u})$) and formula (\ref{e:tha:X_f_comp})
with (\ref{e:bas:arrow_form_comp}). These dualities occur because both $\Omega$
and $\w{g}$ are \emph{non-degenerate} bilinear forms.
\end{remark}


The Poisson bracket (\ref{e:tha:Poisson_bracket}) can be expressed
in terms of the symplectic form $\Omega$ acting of the pair of
vector fields $(X_f, X_g)$:
\be \label{e:tha:Poisson_bracket_X}
    \encadre{ \{f,g\} = - \Omega(X_f, X_g) }.
\ee
\begin{proof}
Starting from Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:Poisson_bracket}) and using Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:Df_Omega_X_f}),
we have $\{f,g\} = (\Omega^{-1})^{ab} \partial_a f \, \partial_b g
= (\Omega^{-1})^{ab} \Omega_{ac} X_f^c \, \Omega_{bd} X_g^d
= \delta^a_{\ \, d}  \Omega_{ac} X_f^c X_g^d = \Omega_{dc}  X_f^c X_g^d = \Omega(X_g, X_f)
= -  \Omega(X_f, X_g)$.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
Notice the minus sign in Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:Poisson_bracket_X}), as compared to Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:Poisson_bracket}); of course,
since $\Omega$ is antisymmetric, Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:Poisson_bracket_X})
can be recast as $\{f,g\} = \Omega(X_g, X_f)$.
\end{remark}

By combining Eqs.~(\ref{e:tha:Df_Omega_X_f}) and (\ref{e:tha:Poisson_bracket_X})
there comes $\langle \Dd f, X_g \rangle = \Omega(X_g, X_f) = \{f,g\}$.
Hence, we get various equivalent expressions for the
Poisson bracket:
\be \label{e:tha:crochet_Poisson_equiv}
     \{f,g\} := \Omega^{-1}(\Dd f, \Dd g)  = \Omega(X_g, X_f)
     = \langle \Dd f, X_g \rangle = X_g(f) .
\ee


The \defin{Hamiltonian vector field}\index{Hamiltonian!vector field} is
the vector field on $\FF$ associated to the Hamiltonian differential $\Dd H$
by symplectic duality, i.e. the vector field $X_H$.
It obeys Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:Df_Omega_X_f}):
\be \label{e:tha:DH_Omega_X_H}
    \encadre{ \Dd H = \Omega(., X_H) }.
\ee

\begin{remark}
In the mathematical literature (e.g. \cite{Lee13}), the vector field
$X_f$ associated to any scalar function $f$ on $\FF$
is called the \emph{Hamiltonian vector field of} $f$. This reflects the
fact that any scalar function $f$ can the considered as the Hamiltonian
of some theory, even if the latter is unphysical.
\end{remark}

given solution in these families; these points can also be viewed as defining

\end{figure}

\begin{example}[phase space of a pendulum]
\label{x:tha:pendulum}
A simple gravity pendulum is a system with $N=1$, the unique degree of
freedom being the angle $\theta\in(-\pi,\pi]$ with respect to the vertical direction.
For a unit mass, the Lagrangian is
$L(\th,\dot{\th}) = (\ell\dot{\th})^2/2 + g \ell \cos\th$,
where $\ell$ is the length of the (massless) and $g$
the magnitude of the vertical gravity field. The momentum conjugate to $\th$
is $p_\th = \dert{L}{\dot{\th}} = \ell^2\dot{\th}$. Since the latter can
take any real value, the phase space $\FF$ is the 2-dimensional infinite cylinder
$\SS^1 \times \mathbb{R}$,
spanned by the canonical coordinates $(\th,p_\th)$. The
Hamiltonian is deduced from $L$ by a Legendre transform: $H = p_\th \dot{\th} - L$,
yielding
$H(\theta,p_\theta) = p_\theta^2 / (2\ell^2) - g\ell\cos\theta$.
The Hamiltonian vector field is obtained via Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:X_f_canonical}):
$X_H = \ell^{-2} p_\th \, \partial_\th - g \ell \sin\th \, \partial_{p_\th}$.
It is depicted in Fig.~\ref{f:tha:pendulum_phase}.
\end{example}

%\begin{example}[phase space as the cotangent bundle of configuration space]
%In Example~\ref{x:tha:pendulum}, the space in which the degree of
%freedom $\theta$ evolves is the 1-dimensional manifold $\mathcal{C} = \mathbb{S}^1$.
%More generally, for a system of $N$ degrees of freedom, the space spanned by the
%latter is a $N$-dimensional manifold $\mathcal{C}$, called the
%\defin{configuration space}\index{configuration space}.
%\end{example}

Equation~(\ref{e:tha:Xf_Poisson_f}) with $f=H$ leads to
$\{f,H\} = X_H(f)$ for any scalar field $f$ on $\FF$.
Accordingly, the evolution
equation (\ref{e:tha:dfdt_Poisson_fH}) can be rewritten as
\be \label{e:tha:dfdt_X_H_f}
    \derd{f}{t} = X_H(f).
\ee
In particular, Hamilton's equations (\ref{e:evo_Hamilton_eqs_finite}) become
\be \label{e:evo_Hamilton_eqs_X_H}
    \derd{q^i}{t} = X_H(q^i) \qand \derd{p_i}{t} = X_H(p_i) , \quad 1 \leq i \leq N .
\ee
It follows that any solution $(q^i(t),p_i(t))$ to the equations of motion is an
integral curve of the Hamiltonian vector field in the phase space
(cf. Fig.~\ref{x:tha:pendulum}). $H$ is constant along such a curve, since,
from Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:DH_Omega_X_H}),
$X_H(H) = \langle \Dd H, X_H \rangle = \Omega(X_H, X_H) = 0$.

In view of Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:dfdt_X_H_f}), one may consider the vector field $X_H$ as
defining the ``time evolution'' without having to refer explicitely
to the time coordinate $t$.
Of course, we recover from Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:dfdt_X_H_f})
that $\D H/\D t = 0$ since $X_H(H) = 0$.
For tensor fields on $\FF$ of valence higher than a scalar field,
one  defines the ``time evolution'' as the
\emph{Lie derivative} $\Liesymbol_{X_H}$ along the Hamiltonian vector field $X_H$.
This is quite natural since the vanishing of $\Liesymbol_{X_H} T$ means
that the tensor field $T$ is transported identically to itself along the flow
defined by $X_H$ (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:bas:Lie}).
In particular, this encompasses Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:dfdt_X_H_f}), since
$\Liesymbol_{X_H} f = X_H(f)$ for any scalar field $f$.
An important feature of the evolution thus defined is that
the symplectic form is conserved:
\be \label{e:tha:Lie_X_H_Omega}
   \encadre{ \Liesymbol_{X_H} \Omega = 0 }.
\ee
\begin{proof}
The proof relies on the fact that $\Omega$ is closed, i.e. $\Dd\Omega = 0$.
Indeed, using successively the Cartan
identity (\ref{e:bas:Cartan}) and Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:DH_Omega_X_H}), we get
\[
     \Liesymbol_{X_H} \Omega  = X_H \cdot \underbrace{\Dd \Omega}_{0}
     + \Dd(\underbrace{X_H\cdot\Omega}_{\Omega(X_H, .)})
     = - \Dd(\underbrace{\Omega(., X_H)}_{\Dd H})
     = - \Dd \Dd H = 0 ,
\]
the last equality following from the nilpotence of the exterior derivative
[Eq.~(\ref{e:ext_der_nilpot})].
\end{proof}

Let us summarize the above results as follows:

\begin{prop}[Hamiltonian system]
A \defin{Hamiltonian system}\index{Hamiltonian!system}
is a triplet $(\FF,\Omega,H)$ where $\FF$ is a smooth
manifold, called the \defin{phase space}\index{phase space} of the system, $\Omega$ is
a \defin{symplectic form}\index{symplectic!form} on $\FF$, i.e. a closed non-degenerate
2-form, and $H$ is a smooth function $\FF \to \R$ called
the \defin{Hamiltonian}.
The differential of $H$ is a 1-form $\Dd H$ on
$\FF$, whose symplectic dual defines
the \defin{Hamiltonian vector field}\index{Hamiltonian!vector field},
namely the unique vector field $X_H$
on $\FF$ such that
\be \label{e:tha:DH_Omega_X_H_2}
\Dd H = \Omega(., X_H) .
\ee
By construction, $X_H$ preserves the symplectic
form: $\Liesymbol_{X_H} \Omega = 0$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:Lie_X_H_Omega})].
The evolution of the underlying physical system is entirely determined
by the Hamiltonian vector field: any solution of the equations of motion
is an integral curve of $X_H$.
A smooth function $f: \ \FF \to \R$ is called a
\defin{conserved quantity}\index{conserved!quantity} iff $f$ is constant on every integral curve
of $X_H$, i.e. iff $X_H(f) = 0$. In view of Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:crochet_Poisson_equiv}),
this is equivalent to $\{f,H\} = 0$.
A conserved quantity is $H$ itself. Its value for a given solution of the equations of motion
is called the \defin{energy}\index{energy!in Hamiltonian framework} of the solution.
An \defin{equilibrium point} is a point of $\FF$ where $X_H = 0$,
or equivalently, given Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:DH_Omega_X_H_2}), a point where
$\Dd H = 0$.
\end{prop}

\begin{example}[solutions for the pendulum motion]
The integral curves of $X_H$ are depicted in Fig.~\ref{f:tha:pendulum_phase}
for the gravity pendulum (Example~\ref{x:tha:pendulum}). Two of them are
are represented by the red and the blue curves. It is clear from the figure
that $X_H$ vanishes at two points: $(\th,p_\th) = (0,0)$ and $(\th,p_\th) = (\pi,0)$,
which are thus two equilibrium points (respectively stable and unstable).
\end{example}

\begin{remark}
The above formulation of Hamiltonian systems is covariant: it does not
refer to any system of canonical coordinates $(q^i, p_i)$ on $\FF$
and, more generally, to any kind of coordinates.
It does not even assume that $\FF$ is the cotangent bundle $T^*\mathcal{C}$
of some ``configuration space'' $\mathcal{C}$, the latter structure being the standard
arena for the Hamiltonian mechanics with finite number of degrees
of freedom \cite{AbrahM78}.
\end{remark}

There is one, and exactly one,
integral curve of $X_H$ through each point\footnote{At an equilibrium point, the
integral curve is reduced to the point itself.} of $\FF$.
It follows that a solution is entirely determined by a single point $a\in\FF$,
which can be thought of as representing the state of the system at some initial
instant $t=0$, i.e. the coordinates of $a$ are $(q^i(0),p_i(0))$
(cf. Fig.~\ref{f:tha:pendulum_phase}).
If the initial value problem is well posed, there is a one-to-one
correspondance between a point of $\FF$ and a solution.
Consequently, one may view $\FF$ as the \emph{space of solutions}
to the equations of motion. This is the essence of the
so-called \defin{covariant phase space}\index{covariant phase space}\index{covariant!phase space}\index{phase space!covariant --} approach.


\subsection{First law for diffeomorphism-invariant theories}


Let us apply the above considerations to a gravity
theory governed by a Lagrangian of the type (\ref{e:tha:Lagrangian_diffeo_inv}).
A difference with what precedes is that
we are dealing with a field theory, which, by essence, has
an infinite number of degrees of freedom. In other words,
the space $\FF$ of solutions $\w{g}$ to the field equations is
an \emph{infinite-dimensional manifold}, more precisely an
infinite-dimensional \defin{Banach manifold}\index{Banach manifold}\index{manifold!Banach --}
\cite{LeeW90,HarloW20}, i.e. a topological space that locally resembles\footnote{Cf. Lang's book~\cite{Lang95} for a
precise definition.} a Banach space of infinite dimension, in the same
way as a $n$-dimensional manifold locally resembles the vector space $\mathbb{R}^n$.
Since any point of $\FF$ is a metric field $\w{g}$ on $\M$, a variation $\delta\w{g}$
can be viewed as an infinitesimal displacement vector between two neighboring points of the manifold
$\FF$, similar to the displacement vector $\D\w{x}$ on $\M$ introduced in Secs.~\ref{s:fra:general_settings} and \ref{s:bas:vectors}.
As in the finite dimensional case
(cf. Sec.~\ref{s:bas:vectors}), finite vectors on $\FF$
are defined\footnote{Notice that the definition (\ref{e:bas:def_vector}) of a tangent vector
does not require the manifold to be of finite dimension.} as tangent vectors
along \emph{curves of} $\FF$, the latter being the images of smooth maps
$P: I\subset \R \to  \FF$, $\lambda\mapsto P(\lambda) =: \w{g}(\lambda)$. Here
$\w{g}(\lambda)$ stands for a 1-parameter family of metric fields
on $\M$, this family constituting a parametrization of a given curve $\mathcal{L}$ of $\FF$.
Any vector $X$ at a point $\w{g}_0 \in \FF$ can then be written as in Eq.~(\ref{e:bas:dell_v_dlamb}):
\be \label{e:tha:X_dg/dlambda}
    X = \frac{\delta\w{g}}{\delta\lambda} ,
\ee
where $\delta\w{g}$ is the infinitesimal displacement vector connecting $\w{g}_0 =: \w{g}(\lambda)$
and $\w{g}(\lambda+\delta\lambda)$ along the curve $\mathcal{L}$
to which $X$ is tangent to; $\lambda$ is then the parameter of $\mathcal{L}$ associated to $X$
and we denote by $\delta\lambda$ its small increment, instead of $\D\lambda$ as in Sec.~\ref{s:bas:vectors}.

From the spacetime symplectic potential $(n-1)$-form $\w{\theta}[\w{g},\delta\w{g}]$
(cf. Property~\ref{p:tha:var_Lagrangian}), we may define a 1-form $\Theta$ on $\FF$ as follows.
Let us assume that the spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$ is globally hyperbolic and asymptotically flat.
Let then $\Sigma$ be a Cauchy surface\index{Cauchy!surface}
(cf. the definition given on p.~\pageref{d:sta:Cauchy_surface}).
At a point $\w{g}\in\FF$, we define the action of $\Theta$ on a vector $X$ in the
tangent space $T_{\w{g}} \FF$ by
\be \label{e:tha:def_Theta_X_theta}
    \langle \Theta, X \rangle\,  \delta\lambda := \int_{\Sigma} \w{\theta}[\w{g},\delta\w{g}],
\ee
where $\delta\w{g}$ is the variation of $\w{g}$ along the vector $X$ in the space of solutions $\FF$
and $\delta\lambda$ is the small parameter increment along the curve connecting
$\w{g}$ to $\w{g}+\delta\w{g}$ in $\FF$,
so that
Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:X_dg/dlambda}) holds, i.e. $\delta\w{g} = \delta\lambda \, X$.
The integral in the right-hand side of Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:def_Theta_X_theta}) is a priori well-defined
since $\w{\theta}[\w{g},\delta\w{g}]$ is a $(n-1)$-form on $\M$ and $\Sigma$
is a submanifold of $\M$ of dimension $n-1$. Moreover, we assume that the asymptotic flatness conditions
ensure that the integral is always convergent, giving birth a finite real number.
Since $\w{\theta}[\w{g},\delta\w{g}]$ is linear in its argument $\delta\w{g}$
(cf. Property~\ref{p:tha:var_Lagrangian}), we may rewrite (\ref{e:tha:def_Theta_X_theta}) as
\be \label{e:tha:Theta_X_theta_partial}
    \langle \Theta, X \rangle := \int_{\Sigma} \w{\theta}\left[\w{g},\frac{\delta\w{g}}{\delta\lambda}\right] .
\ee
The map $\Theta: T_{\w{g}} \FF \to \R$ thus defined is clearly linear, given that
$\w{\theta}[\cdot,\cdot]$ is linear in its second argument.
Hence $\Theta$ is a linear form on the tangent space $T_{\w{g}} \FF$; furthermore we shall assume
that it is continuous (recall that linearity does not imply continuity in infinite dimension),
so that $\Theta$ belongs to the dual space of the tangent space to $\FF$ at $\w{g}$:
$\Theta \in T_{\w{g}}^* \FF$. By letting the point $\w{g}$ vary over all $\FF$, this defines
a 1-form on $\FF$, which we shall denote by the same symbol $\Theta$.
In order to endow $\FF$ with a symplectic form, hence turning it into a covariant phase space,
let us consider the exterior derivative of $\Theta$, i.e.
the 2-form
\be
    \Omega := \Dd \Theta .
\ee
This is analogous to Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:Omega_dTheta})
and explains why $\w{\theta}$ has been called the \emph{symplectic potential $(n-1)$-form}.
Let us evaluate the action of $\Omega$ on a pair of two vectors fields $(X_1, X_2)$
on $\FF$. According to Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:X_dg/dlambda}),
each vector field describes the variation of $\w{g}$ along some curves of $\FF$
and we choose $(X_1, X_2)$ to describe two \emph{independent} variations as follows.
Let us consider a parametrized 2-surface on $\FF$,
i.e. the image $\mathcal{S}\subset \FF$ of a map $\Phi: I_1\times I_2 \to \FF$, $(\lambda_1,\lambda_2) \mapsto \w{g}(\lambda_1,\lambda_2)$,
where $I_1$ and $I_2$ are two real intervals. This amounts to considering a 2-parameter family
$\w{g}(\lambda_1,\lambda_2)$
of metric tensors. The vector field $X_1$ (resp. $X_2$) on $\FF$ corresponds then to variations
$\delta\w{g}$
along curves $\lambda_2 = \mathrm{const}$ (resp. $\lambda_1 = \mathrm{const}$) in the 2-surface $\mathcal{S}$, i.e. to partial derivatives:
\be \label{e:tha:def_X1_X2}
    X_1 = \left. \frac{\delta\w{g}}{\delta\lambda_1} \right| _{\lambda_2=\mathrm{const}}
      =: \der{\w{g}}{\lambda_1}  \qand
    X_2 = \left. \frac{\delta\w{g}}{\delta\lambda_2} \right| _{\lambda_1=\mathrm{const}}
      =: \der{\w{g}}{\lambda_2} .
\ee
Let us compute $\Omega(X_1,X_2) = \Dd \Theta (X_1,X_2)$ via formula
(\ref{e:bas:def_ext_der_p1}) for the exterior derivative, noticing that (i) this formula
does not involve the manifold dimensionality (contrary to formula (\ref{e:bas:def_ext_1f}),
which applies to finite dimensions only) and (ii) the last term in its right-hand
side vanishes since $[X_1,X_2] = 0$ (commutation of partial derivatives).
We get
\begin{align}
    \Omega(X_1,X_2) & = X_1\left( \langle \Theta, X_2 \rangle \right)
        -  X_2\left( \langle \Theta, X_1 \rangle \right) \nonumber \\
        & =  \der{}{\lambda_1} \langle \Theta, X_2 \rangle -
            \der{}{\lambda_2} \langle \Theta, X_1 \rangle \nonumber \\
        & = \der{}{\lambda_1} \int_{\Sigma} \w{\theta}\left[\w{g}, \der{\w{g}}{\lambda_2} \right]
        - \der{}{\lambda_2} \int_{\Sigma} \w{\theta}\left[\w{g}, \der{\w{g}}{\lambda_1} \right]   \nonumber \\
        & = \int_{\Sigma} \left\{ \der{}{\lambda_1}
        \left( \w{\theta}\left[\w{g}, \der{\w{g}}{\lambda_2} \right]\right)
        - \der{}{\lambda_2}\left( \w{\theta}\left[\w{g}, \der{\w{g}}{\lambda_1} \right] \right) \right\} .
        \nonumber
\end{align}
The second equality results from $X_1(f) = \dert{f}{\lambda_1}$ for the scalar field
$f := \langle \Theta, X_2 \rangle$ [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:bas:def_vector})], the third equality
makes use of Eqs.~(\ref{e:tha:Theta_X_theta_partial}) and (\ref{e:tha:def_X1_X2})
and the last equality stems from the linearity of the integral.
We may write the above result as
\be
    \encadre{ \Omega(X_1,X_2) =  \int_{\Sigma} \w{\omega}\left[\w{g},  \der{\w{g}}{\lambda_1},
                            \der{\w{g}}{\lambda_2} \right] } ,
\ee
with
\be \label{e:tha:def_omega_der_theta}
 \encadre{ \w{\omega}\left[\w{g},  \der{\w{g}}{\lambda_1}, \der{\w{g}}{\lambda_2} \right]
    :=  \der{}{\lambda_1}
        \left( \w{\theta}\left[\w{g}, \der{\w{g}}{\lambda_2} \right]\right)
        - \der{}{\lambda_2}\left( \w{\theta}\left[\w{g}, \der{\w{g}}{\lambda_1} \right] \right) } .
\ee
$\w{\omega}$ is a $(n-1)$-form on spacetime, which depends locally on the metric tensor $\w{g}$,
and the derivatives $\dert{\w{g}}{\lambda_1}$ and $\dert{\w{g}}{\lambda_2}$
associated to the 2-parameter family $\w{g}(\lambda_1,\lambda_2)$. We observe
that $\w{\omega}$ does not depend on the second derivative
$\frac{\partial^2\w{g}}{\partial\lambda_1\partial\lambda_2}$ because the second derivatives,
which appear in each of the two terms of the right-hand side of
Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:def_omega_der_theta}), cancel each other thanks to the
identity
$\frac{\partial^2\w{g}}{\partial\lambda_1\partial\lambda_2} = \frac{\partial^2\w{g}}{\partial\lambda_2\partial\lambda_1}$.
Moreover, we observe as well that $\w{\omega}$ is linear with respect to $\der{\w{g}}{\lambda_1}$
and with respect to $\der{\w{g}}{\lambda_2}$.

An important property of $\w{\omega}$ is to be a closed $(n-1)$-form:
\be \label{e:tha:omega_closed}
    \dd \w{\omega} = 0 .
\ee
\begin{proof}
The 2-parameter family of metric tensors $\w{g}(\lambda_1,\lambda_2)$ gives birth
to a 2-parameter family of Lagrangian $n$-forms
$\w{L}(\lambda_1,\lambda_2) := \w{L}[\w{g}(\lambda_1,\lambda_2)]$.
The variation $\delta_1\w{L}$ of $\w{L}$ corresponding to a variation of $\lambda_1$ is
given by Eq.~(\ref{e:tha:delta_L_E_Theta}) with $E^{\mu\nu} = 0$ since
we are considering only families of solutions of the field equations (equivalently,
all displacements $\delta\w{g}$ are taking place within the 2-surface
$\mathcal{S}$, which is part of the space $\FF$ of solutions). Hence
$\delta_1 \w{L} = \dd \left( \w{\theta}[\w{g}, \delta_1 \w{g}] \right)$.
Given that $\delta_1 \w{L} = \der{\w{L}}{\lambda_1}  \, \delta \lambda_1$,
$\delta_1 \w{g} = \der{\w{g}}{\lambda_1} \, \delta \lambda_1$
and $\w{\theta}[.,.]$ is linear with respect to its second argument, we get
\[
    \der{\w{L}}{\lambda_1} = \dd \left( \w{\theta} \left[\w{g},  \der{\w{g}}{\lambda_1} \right] \right) .
\]
Taking the derivative of this expression with respect to $\lambda_2$ yields
\[
    \frac{\partial^2\w{L}}{\partial\lambda_2\partial\lambda_1} = \der{}{\lambda_2}
        \dd \left( \w{\theta} \left[\w{g},  \der{\w{g}}{\lambda_1} \right] \right)
        = \dd  \der{}{\lambda_2} \left( \w{\theta} \left[\w{g},  \der{\w{g}}{\lambda_1} \right] \right) .
\]
Performing a swap of $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ and subtracting the above formula
yields, in view of $\w{\omega}$'s definition (\ref{e:tha:def_omega_der_theta}),
$\frac{\partial^2\w{L}}{\partial\lambda_1\partial\lambda_2} - \frac{\partial^2\w{L}}{\partial\lambda_2\partial\lambda_1} = \dd\w{\omega}$. But the left-hand side of this equation
is trivially zero, hence the result (\ref{e:tha:omega_closed}).
\end{proof}
