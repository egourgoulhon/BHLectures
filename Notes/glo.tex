\section{Introduction}

Having attempted in Chaps.~\ref{s:def} and \ref{s:neh} to characterize a black hole by the local
properties of its boundary, we turn now to the general definition of a black
hole. As it could have been anticipated from the naive ``definition'' given
in Sec.~\ref{s:def:first_defin}, the mathematically meaningful definition
of a black hole cannot be local: it has to take into account the full
spacetime structure, in particular its future asymptotics. Indeed, to conclude
firmly that a null geodesic has escaped, one has to wait until the ``end
of time''...

In this chapter, we therefore consider the global spacetime picture to
arrive at the general definition of a black hole in
Sec.~\ref{s:glo:BH}.
This amounts to focusing on the
spacetime asymptotics, which can be seen as
the region where the ``distant observers'' live and may, or may not, receive
light rays from some ``central region''. This far-away structure is best
described in terms of the so-called \emph{conformal completion}, which brings
the spacetime infinity(ies) to a finite distance in another manifold.
We start by investigating the conformal completion of the simplest
spacetime: Minkowski spacetime.

\section{Conformal completion of Minkowski spacetime} \label{s:glo:conf_Mink}

In this section $(\M,\w{g})$ is the 4-dimensional Minkowski spacetime,
i.e. $\M$ is a smooth manifold diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^4$ and $\w{g}$
is the metric tensor whose expression in terms of some global coordinates
$(x^\alpha) = (t, x, y, z)$ implementing the diffeomorphism to $\mathbb{R}^4$
(i.e. \defin{Minkowskian coordinates}\index{Minkowskian!coordinates})
is
\be \label{e:glo:Mink_metric}
    g_{\mu\nu} \D x^\mu \D x^\nu = - \D t^2 + \D x^2 + \D y^2 + \D z^2 .
\ee

\subsection{Finite-range coordinates on Minkowski spacetime}

Since we would like to deal with the ``far'' region, it is natural to introduce
$r := \sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$ and the associated spherical coordinates
$(x^\alpha) = (t,r,\th,\ph)$, which are related to the Minkowskian ones by
\be
    \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
    x = r\sin\th\cos\ph \\
    y = r\sin\th\sin\ph \\
    z = r\cos\th .
    \end{array} \right.
\ee
The coordinates $(t, r,\th,\ph)$ span
$\mathbb{R}\times(0,+\infty)\times (0,\pi) \times (0,2\pi)$; they do not cover
the whole manifold $\M$ as a regular chart (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:bas:def_manif} of Appendix~\ref{s:bas}), but only $\M\setminus \Pi$, where $\Pi$ is the closed half hyperplane defined
by $y=0$ and $x\geq 0$. Once expressed in terms of the
spherical coordinates, the Minkowski metric (\ref{e:glo:Mink_metric}) takes the form
\be \label{e:glo:Mink_metric_spher}
    g_{\mu\nu} \D x^\mu \D x^\nu = - \D t^2 + \D r^2
        + r^2 \left( \D\th^2 + \sin^2\th \, \D\ph^2 \right) .
\ee

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{glo_null_coord.pdf}}
\caption[]{\label{f:glo:null_coord} \footnotesize
Lines of constant null coordinates $u$ (dashed) and $v$
(solid) in terms of the coordinates $(t,r)$.}
\end{figure}


Let us introduce the null coordinate system $(u,v,\th,\ph)$ where $u$ and
$v$ are respectively the retarded\index{retarded!time} and advanced\index{advanced!time}
time defined by (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:glo:null_coord})
\be \label{e:glo:advanced_retarded}
    \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
    u = t - r\\
    v = t + r
    \end{array} \right.
    \iff
    \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
    t = \frac{1}{2} (v+u)\\[1ex]
    r = \frac{1}{2} (v-u) .
    \end{array} \right.
\ee
The metric tensor takes then the shape
\be \label{e:glo:Mink_metric_uv}
    g_{\mu\nu} \D x^\mu \D x^\nu = - \D u \, \D v
        + \frac{1}{4} (v-u)^2 \left(  \D\th^2 + \sin^2\th \, \D\ph^2 \right) .
\ee
The coordinates $(u,v)$ span the half part of $\mathbb{R}^2$ defined by
$u<v$. In order to have coordinates within a finite range, let us consider
their arctangents (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:glo:atan}):
\be \label{e:glo:UV_uv}
    \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
    U = \arctan u \\
    V = \arctan v
    \end{array} \right.
    \iff
   \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
    u = \tan U \\
    v = \tan V .
    \end{array} \right.
\ee
Then the coordinates $(U,V)$ span the half part of $(-\pi/2, \pi/2)\times (-\pi/2, \pi/2)$
defined by $U < V$
(since $\arctan$ is a monotonically increasing function, cf. Fig.~\ref{f:glo:atan}):
\be \label{e:glo:span_UV}
    -\frac{\pi}{2} < U < \frac{\pi}{2}, \quad
    -\frac{\pi}{2} < V < \frac{\pi}{2}, \quad\mbox{and}\quad U < V.
\ee

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{glo_atan.pdf}}
\caption[]{\label{f:glo:atan} \footnotesize
The arctangent function mapping $\mathbb{R}$ to $(-\pi/2, \pi/2)$.}
\end{figure}

Since
\[
    \D u = \frac{\D U}{\cos^2 U}, \quad \D v = \frac{\D V}{\cos^2 V}
    \quad\mbox{and}\quad
    \tan V - \tan U = \frac{\sin(V-U)}{\cos U \cos V},
\]
the Minkowski metric (\ref{e:glo:Mink_metric_uv})
is expressed in terms of the coordinates $(x^\alpha)=(U,V,\th,\ph)$
as\footnote{See also Sec.~\ref{s:sam:worksheets} for the computation
with SageManifolds.}
\be \label{e:glo:g_UV}
    g_{\mu\nu} \D x^\mu \D x^\nu = \frac{1}{4\cos^2 U \cos^2 V}
    \left[ - 4 \D U \, \D V + \sin^2(V-U) \left(  \D\th^2 + \sin^2\th \, \D\ph^2 \right)
    \right] .
\ee

\begin{remark}
The retarded/advanced times $u$ and $v$ have the dimension of a time, or of a
length in the $c=1$ units that we are using. Therefore, one should introduce
some length scale, $\ell_0$ say, before taking their arctangent and rewrite
(\ref{e:glo:UV_uv}) as
\[
    \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
    U = \arctan (u/\ell_0) \\
    V = \arctan (v/\ell_0)
    \end{array} \right.
    \iff
   \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
    u = \ell_0 \tan U \\
    v = \ell_0 \tan V .
    \end{array} \right.
\]
The coordinates $(U,V)$ are dimensionless and a global factor $\ell_0^2$ should be
introduced in the right-hand side of Eq.~(\ref{e:glo:g_UV}).
However, the length scale $\ell_0$ plays no essential role and, to keep simple notations,
it is omitted in what follows. In other words, we are using units for
which $\ell_0=1$.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Conformal metric}

In the right-hand side of (\ref{e:glo:g_UV}),
the terms in square brackets defines a metric
$\w{\tilde{g}}$ such that
\be \label{e:glo:tilde_g_Omega}
    \encadre{ \w{\tilde{g}} = \Omega^2 \w{g} } ,
\ee
where $\Omega$ is the scalar field $\M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ obeying
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
    \Omega & =  2 \cos U \cos V \label{e:glo:Omega_UV} \\
           & =  \frac{2}{\sqrt{1+u^2}\sqrt{1+v^2}} \label{e:glo:Omega_uv}\\
           & =  \frac{2}{\sqrt{(t-r)^2+1}\sqrt{(t+r)^2+1}} . \label{e:glo:Omega_tr}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
We notice on (\ref{e:glo:Omega_uv}) and (\ref{e:glo:Omega_tr}) that the function
$\Omega$ never vanishes on $\M$, so that the bilinear form $\w{\tilde{g}}$ defined by
(\ref{e:glo:tilde_g_Omega}) constitutes a well behaved metric on $\M$.
Moreover, since $\Omega^2 > 0$, $\w{\tilde{g}}$ has the same signature as
$\w{g}$, i.e. $(-,+,+,+)$.
The specific expression of $\w{\tilde{g}}$ is deduced from (\ref{e:glo:g_UV})
and (\ref{e:glo:Omega_UV}):
\be \label{e:glo:tg_UV}
    \tilde{g}_{\mu\nu} \D x^\mu \D x^\nu =  - 4 \D U \, \D V
        + \sin^2(V-U) \left(  \D\th^2 + \sin^2\th \, \D\ph^2 \right) .
\ee

In view of (\ref{e:glo:tilde_g_Omega}), one says that the metric $\w{\tilde{g}}$
is \defin{conformal to}\index{conformal} the metric $\w{g}$, or equivalently,
that the metrics $\w{g}$ and $\w{\tilde{g}}$ are
\defin{conformally related}\index{conformally related metrics},
or that $\w{\tilde{g}}$ arises from $\w{g}$ via a
\defin{conformal transformation}\index{conformal!transformation}.
The scalar field $\Omega$ is called the \defin{conformal factor}\index{conformal!factor}.

A key property of a conformal transformation is to preserve the orthogonality
relations, since (\ref{e:glo:tilde_g_Omega}) clearly
implies, at any point $p\in\M$,
\[
    \forall (\w{u},\w{v})\in T_p\M\times T_p\M,\quad
    \w{\tilde{g}}(\w{u},\w{v}) = 0 \iff \w{g}(\w{u},\w{v}) = 0 .
\]
In particular, null vectors for $\w{\tilde{g}}$ coincide with null vectors for $\w{g}$:
\[
    \forall \wl \in T_p\M,\quad
    \w{\tilde{g}}(\wl,\wl) = 0 \iff \w{g}(\wl,\wl) = 0 .
\]
Consequently the light cones of $(\M,\w{g})$ and $(\M,\w{\tilde{g}})$
are identical.
Moreover, since $\Omega^2>0$, the spacelike and timelike characters of vectors
is preserved as well:
\be
    \begin{array}{ll}
    \forall \w{v} \in T_p\M,\ &
        \w{v} \mbox{\ spacelike for\ } \w{\tilde{g}} \iff \w{v} \mbox{\ spacelike for\ } \w{g} \\
    & \w{v} \mbox{\ timelike for\ } \w{\tilde{g}} \iff \w{v} \mbox{\ timelike for\ } \w{g} .
    \end{array}
\ee
It follows that a curve $\Li$ is timelike (resp. null, spacelike) for $\w{\tilde{g}}$
iff $\Li$ is timelike (resp. null, spacelike) for $\w{g}$. Similarly,
a hypersurface $\Sigma$ is timelike (resp. null, spacelike) for $\w{\tilde{g}}$
iff $\Li$ is timelike (resp. null, spacelike) for $\w{g}$.

What about geodesics? Let us first recall that a null curve is not necessarily
a null geodesic (cf. Remark~\ref{r:def:null_curves} on page~\pageref{r:def:null_curves}),
so that one cannot deduce from the above results that conformal transformations
preserve null geodesics. However, this turns out to be true:
\begin{greybox}
A smooth curve $\Li$ in $\M$ is a null geodesic for $\w{\tilde{g}}$ iff
$\Li$ is a null geodesic for $\w{g}$.
\end{greybox}
To prove it, it suffices to write explicitly the geodesic equation
and to express the Christoffel symbols of $\w{\tilde{g}}$ in terms of those
of $\w{g}$ and the derivatives of $\Omega$ (see e.g. Appendix~D of Wald's
textbook \cite{Wald84} for details).

On the contrary conformal transformations preserve neither the timelike
geodesics nor the spacelike ones.

The coordinates $(U,V)$ are of null type; let us consider instead
the ``time+space'' coordinates $(\tau,\chi)$ defined by\footnote{Notice the
similarity with (\ref{e:glo:advanced_retarded}) up to some $1/2$ factors.}
\be \label{e:glo:tau_chi_U_V}
    \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
    \tau = V + U \\
    \chi = V - U
    \end{array} \right.
    \iff
    \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
    U = \frac{1}{2} (\tau - \chi) \\[1ex]
    V = \frac{1}{2} (\tau + \chi) .
    \end{array} \right.
\ee
Given (\ref{e:glo:span_UV}), the range of these new coordinates is
\be \label{e:glo:range_tau_chi}
    0 < \chi < \pi \quad\mbox{and}\quad
    \chi - \pi < \tau < \pi - \chi .
\ee
In other words, if we draw the Minkowski spacetime in the $(\tau,\chi)$ plane,
it takes the shape of a half-diamond: see Fig.~\ref{f:glo:conf_diag_Mink}.

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{glo_conf_diag_Mink.pdf}}
\caption[]{\label{f:glo:conf_diag_Mink} \footnotesize
Conformal diagram of Minkowski spacetime. Constant-$r$ curves are drawn in
red, while constant-$t$ ones are drawn in grey.}
\end{figure}

By combining (\ref{e:glo:advanced_retarded}) (\ref{e:glo:UV_uv}) and
(\ref{e:glo:tau_chi_U_V}), we get the link between $(t,r)$ and
$(\tau,\chi)$:
\be \label{e:glo:tau_chi_t_r}
    \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
    \tau = \arctan(t+r) + \arctan(t-r) \\
    \chi = \arctan(t+r) - \arctan(t-r)
    \end{array} \right.
    \iff
    \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
    \displaystyle t = \frac{\sin\tau}{\cos\tau + \cos\chi}\\[2ex]
    \displaystyle r = \frac{\sin\chi}{\cos\tau + \cos\chi} .
    \end{array} \right.
\ee
We may use these relations to draw the lines $t=\mathrm{const}$ and
$r=\mathrm{const}$ in Fig.~\ref{f:glo:conf_diag_Mink}.

The expression of the conformal factor in the
coordinates $(\tau,\chi,\th,\ph)$ is easily deduced from
(\ref{e:glo:Omega_UV}) and
(\ref{e:glo:tau_chi_U_V}):
\be \label{e:glo:Omega_tau_chi}
    \Omega = \cos\tau + \cos\chi .
\ee


\subsection{Conformal completion} \label{s:glo:conf_complet_Mink}

The expression of the conformal metric in terms of the coordinates
$(x^\alpha) = (\tau,\chi,\th,\ph)$ is easily deduced from that in terms of
$(U,V,\th,\ph)$ as given by (\ref{e:glo:tg_UV}):
\be \label{e:glo:tg_Einstein}
    \tilde{g}_{\mu\nu} \D x^\mu \D x^\nu =  - \D\tau^2
        + \D \chi^2
        + \sin^2\chi \left(  \D\th^2 + \sin^2\th \, \D\ph^2 \right) .
\ee
Restricting to a $\tau = \mathrm{const}$ hypersurface, i.e. setting $\D\tau=0$,
we recognize the standard metric of the hypersphere
$\mathbb{S}^3$ in the hyperspherical coordinates $(\chi,\th,\ph)$.
Moreover, we notice that the full metric (\ref{e:glo:tg_Einstein})
is perfectly regular even if we relax
the condition on $\tau$ in (\ref{e:glo:range_tau_chi}), i.e. if we
let $\tau$ span the
entire $\mathbb{R}$. We may then consider the manifold
\be
    \mathscr{E} = \mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{S}^3
\ee
and $\w{\tilde{g}}$ as a Lorentzian metric on $\mathscr{E}$ given by
(\ref{e:glo:tg_Einstein}).
The Lorentzian manifold
$(\mathscr{E},\w{\tilde{g}})$ is nothing but the
\defin{Einstein static universe}\index{Einstein!static universe}\index{static!universe (Einstein)}, also called the \defin{Einstein cylinder}\index{Einstein!cylinder}\index{cylinder!Einstein --},
a static solution of the Einstein equation (\ref{e:bas:Einstein_eq})
with $\Lambda > 0$ and some pressureless matter of uniform density
$\rho = \Lambda/(4\pi)$.
We have thus an embedding\footnote{Cf. Sec.~\ref{s:bas:embed} of Appendix~A} of Minkowski spacetime into the Einstein cylinder:
\be \label{e:glo:embed_Mink_Einst}
     \Phi:\ \M \longrightarrow \mathscr{E}
\ee
and this embedding is a conformal isometry from
$(\M,\w{g})\rightarrow (\Phi(\M),\w{\tilde{g}})$.
In the following, we shall identify $\Phi(\M)$ and $\M$, i.e. use the same
symbol $\M$ to denote the subset of $\mathscr{E}$ that is the image of $\M$ via the
embedding (\ref{e:glo:embed_Mink_Einst}).

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{glo_Einstcyl_Mink.pdf}}
\caption[]{\label{f:glo:Einstcyl_Mink}\footnotesize
Two views of the Einstein cylinder $\mathscr{E}$, with the conformal embedding of
Minkowski spacetime in it.
The red curves are the same constant-$r$ curves
as in Fig.~\ref{f:glo:conf_diag_Mink}, while the black curves are
the same constant-$t$ curves as those drawn in grey in Fig.~\ref{f:glo:conf_diag_Mink}.}
\end{figure}

Since $\mathscr{E}$ and $\M$ have the same dimension, $\M$ is an open subset of $\mathscr{E}$.
Its closure $\overline{\M}$ in $\mathscr{E}$ is (cf.
Figs.~\ref{f:glo:conf_diag_Mink} and \ref{f:glo:Einstcyl_Mink})
\be
    \overline{\M} = \M \cup \scri^+ \cup \scri^- \cup \left\{ i^0 \right\} \cup
            \left\{ i^+ \right\} \cup \left\{ i^- \right\} ,
\ee
where
\begin{itemize}
\item $\scri^+$ is the hypersurface of $\mathscr{E}$ defined by
$\tau = \pi - \chi$ and $0 < \tau < \pi$;
\item $\scri^-$ is the hypersurface of $\mathscr{E}$ defined by
$\tau = \chi - \pi $ and $-\pi  < \tau < 0$;
\item $i^0$ is the point of $\mathscr{E}$ defined by $\tau=0$ and $\chi=\pi$;
\item $i^+$ is the point of $\mathscr{E}$ defined by $\tau=\pi$ and $\chi=0$;
\item $i^-$ is the point of $\mathscr{E}$ defined by $\tau=-\pi$ and $\chi=0$.
\end{itemize}
It is customary to pronounce $\scri$ as ``scri'', for \emph{script i}.

\begin{remark}
On $\mathbb{S}^3$, the hyperspherical coordinates $(\chi,\th,\ph)$
are singular at $\chi=0$ and $\chi=\pi$, so that setting $\chi=0$ (or $\chi=\pi$)
defines a unique point of $\mathbb{S}^3$, whatever the value of $(\th,\ph)$.
Note also that the vertical left boundary of the diamond drawn in
Fig.~\ref{f:glo:conf_diag_Mink}, i.e. the segment defined by
$\tau\in(-\pi,\pi)$ and $\chi=0$, is \emph{not} a part of the boundary
of $\M$ but merely reflect the coordinate singularity at $\chi=0$, in the same
way that the left vertical boundary of Fig.~\ref{f:glo:null_coord}
is not a boundary of Minkowski spacetime but is
due to the coordinate singularity at $r=0$. Note by the way that
$\chi=0$ implies $r=0$ via (\ref{e:glo:tau_chi_t_r}).
\end{remark}

Let
\be
    \scri := \scri^+ \cup \scri^-
\ee
and
\be
    \tilde{\M} := \M \cup \scri .
\ee
$\tilde{\M}$ is naturally a smooth manifold with
boundary\footnote{Cf. Sec.~\ref{s:bas:manif_boundary} for the precise definition.}\index{manifold!with boundary}
and its boundary is $\scri$:
\be
    \partial \tilde{\M} = \scri.
\ee
\begin{remark}
Because closure $\overline{\M}$ is self-intersecting at the point $i^0$
(cf. Fig.~\ref{f:glo:Einstcyl_Mink}), it is not a manifold with boundary: no open neighbourhood of
$i^0$ is homeomorphic to a neighbourhood of $[0,+\infty)\times \mathbb{R}^2$.
At the points $i^+$ and $i^-$, $\overline{\M}$ can be considered as a
topological manifold with boundary, but not as a \emph{smooth} manifold with boundary.
Hence the three points $i^0$, $i^+$ and $i^-$ are excluded from the definition
of the manifold with boundary $\tilde{\M}$.
\end{remark}

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{glo_conf_Mink_null.pdf}}
\caption[]{\label{f:glo:conf_Mink_null}\footnotesize
Null radial geodesics in the conformal diagram of Minkowski spacetime.
The dashed green lines are null geodesics $u=\mathrm{const}$ for
17 values of $u$ uniformly spanning $[-8,8]$, while the solid green lines are
null geodesics $v=\mathrm{const}$ for 17 values of $v$ uniformly spanning $[-8,8]$.}
\end{figure}

The hypersurface $\scri^+$ is the location of $\tilde{\M}$ where all radial null geodesics
terminate, while $\scri^-$ is the location of $\tilde{\M}$ where all these geodesics originate (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:glo:conf_Mink_null}). For this
reason $\scri^+$ is called the
\defin{future null infinity}\index{future!null infinity}\index{null!infinity}
of $(\M,\w{g})$
and $\scri^-$ the \defin{past null infinity}\index{past!null infinity}
of $(\M,\w{g})$.
On the other side, any timelike geodesic of $(\M,\w{g})$ originates at $i\-$ and ends at
$i^+$ (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:glo:conf_diag_Mink}), while any spacelike geodesic
of $(\M,\w{g})$ originates at $i^0$ and terminates there
(after having completed a closed path on $\mathbb{S}^3$ (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:glo:Einstcyl_Mink}).
The point $i^+$ is then called the
\defin{future timelike infinity}\index{future!timelike infinity}\index{timelike!infinity}
of $(\M,\w{g})$,
$i\-$ the \defin{past timelike infinity}\index{past!timelike infinity}
of $(\M,\w{g})$
and $i^0$ the \defin{spacelike infinity}\index{spacelike!infinity} of $(\M,\w{g})$.

As it is clear on the conformal diagram of Fig.~\ref{f:glo:conf_diag_Mink},
both $\scri^+$ and $\scri^-$ are null hypersurfaces of $(\tilde{\M},\w{\tilde{g}})$.

It is precisely because $\Omega$ vanishes (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:glo:Omega_Mink}) at the boundary
\be
    \overline{\M} \setminus \M = \scri^+ \cup \scri^- \cup \left\{ i^0 \right\} \cup
            \left\{ i^+ \right\} \cup \left\{ i^- \right\}

that the conformal transformation (\ref{e:glo:tilde_g_Omega}) brings infinity
of Minkowski space to a finite distance.

\section{Conformal completions and asymptotic flatness} \label{s:glo:conf_compl}

Having investigated the asymptotic structure of Minkowski spacetime
via a conformal completion, let us use the latter to define spacetimes
that ``look like'' Minkowski spacetime asymptotically: we
shall say that a spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$ admits a
\defin{conformal completion}\index{conformal!completion}
iff there exists a Lorentzian manifold with boundary
$(\tilde{\M},\w{\tilde{g}})$ equipped with a smooth non-negative scalar field
$\Omega: \tilde{\M} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\tilde{\M} = \M \cup \scri$, with $\scri := \partial \tilde{\M}$
(the boundary of $\tilde{\M})$;
\item on $\M$, $\w{\tilde{g}} = \Omega^2 \w{g}$;
\item on $\scri$, $\Omega=0$;
\item on $\scri$, $\dd \Omega \not= 0$.
\end{enumerate}
Condition~1 expresses that $\M$ has been endowed with some boundary.
A rigorous formulation of it would be via an embedding $\Phi:\M \rightarrow \tilde{\M}$,
as in Eq.~(\ref{e:glo:embed_Mink_Einst}), so that
$\tilde{\M} = \Phi(\M) \cup \scri$. However, as above, we identify $\Phi(\M)$
with $\M$ and therefore simply write $\tilde{\M} = \M \cup \scri$.
Conditions~2 and 3 express that the boundary of $\M$, which ``lies at an infinite
distance'' with respect to $\w{g}$, has been brought to a
finite distance with respect to $\w{\tilde{g}}$. Indeed, in terms of
length elements, condition~2
implies
\[
    \D s^2 = \frac{1}{\Omega^2} \, \D {\tilde s}^2
\]
with $1/\Omega^2 \rightarrow +\infty$ as one approaches $\scri$
(condition~3).
 Finally, condition~4 ensures
that $\scri$ is a regular hypersurface of $\tilde{\M}$.
It is of course fulfilled by Minkowski spacetime, as we can check graphically
on Fig.~\ref{f:glo:Omega_Mink}: the graph of $\Omega$ has no horizontal slope
at $\scri$.

\begin{remark}
When we say that $(\tilde{\M},\w{\tilde{g}})$ is a Lorentzian manifold with
boundary, this implies that $\w{\tilde{g}}$ is smooth everywhere on $\tilde{\M}$,
including at the boundary $\scri$.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}[conformal completion of AdS$_{n}$ spacetime]
... to be completed ... \\
$\scri$ is timelike
\end{example}

More generally, if $\w{g}$ is a solution of Einstein vacuum equation with
a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:bas:Einstein_eq})], then
\begin{itemize}
\item $\scri$ is a null hypersurface if $\Lambda=0$;
\item $\scri$ is a spacelike hypersurface if $\Lambda>0$;
\item $\scri$ is a timelike hypersurface if $\Lambda<0$.
\end{itemize}
\begin{proof}
... to be completed ...
\end{proof}



Furthermore, one says that $(\tilde{\M},\w{\tilde{g}})$ is a
\defin{conformal completion at null infinity}\index{conformal!completion!at null infinity}
of $(\M,\w{g})$
iff $(\tilde{\M},\w{\tilde{g}})$  is a conformal completion such that
\be
    \scri = \scri^+ \cup \scri^-,
\ee
with $\scri^+$ (resp. $\scri^-$) being never intersected by any past-directed
(resp. future-directed) causal
curve originating in $\M$. Let us recall that a
\defin{causal curve}\index{causal!curve} is
curve whose tangent vectors are nowhere spacelike.
As for Minkowksi spacetime, we shall call $\scri^+$ the
\defin{future null infinity}\index{future!null infinity}\index{null!infinity}
and $\scri^-$ the \defin{past null infinity}\index{past!null infinity}
of $(\M,\w{g})$.

\begin{remark}
One often speaks about \emph{conformal compactification}\index{conformal!compactification}
instead of \emph{conformal completion}, but in general $\tilde{\M}$ is not a
compact manifold. For instance, because we omitted the points $i^+$, $i^-$ and $i^0$,
$\tilde{\M}$ is not compact even for Minkowski spacetime.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
Note that the above definition of $\scri^+$ and $\scri^-$ does not impose
that these two objects are null hypersurfaces of $(\tilde{\M},\w{\tilde{g}})$.
This is true for Minkowski spacetime, but not necessarily for other spacetimes,
as the following example shows.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}[Conformal completion of dS$_{n}$ spacetime]
... to be completed ... \\
$\scri^+$ and $\scri^-$ are spacelike
\end{example}


Penrose \cite{Penro64,Penro68} has defined
a spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$ to be \defin{asymptotically simple}\index{asymptotically!simple} iff there exists
a conformal completion $(\tilde{\M},\w{\tilde{g}})$
of $(\M,\w{g})$
such that every null geodesic in $\M$ has two endpoints in $\scri$.

The last condition, which is verified by Minkowski spacetime (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:glo:conf_Mink_null}), is rather restrictive. In particular, it excludes
black hole spacetimes, since, almost by definition, the latter contain null
geodesics that have no endpoint on $\scri^+$, having only a past endpoint
on $\scri^-$, as far as $\scri$ is concerned. To cope with these spacetimes,
Penrose \cite{Penro68} has introduced the following definition:
a spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$ is
\defin{weakly asymptotically simple}\index{weakly!asymptotically simple} iff
there exists an open subset $\mathscr{U}$ of $\M$ and
an asymptotically simple spacetime $(\M_0, \w{g}_0)$
with an open neighbourhood $\mathscr{U}_0$ of $\scri_0 = \partial \tilde{\M}_0$
in $\tilde{\M}_0$ such that $(\mathscr{U}_0\cap \M_0,\w{g}_0)$ is
isometric to $(\mathscr{U},\w{g})$.

\begin{remark}
For a given weakly asymptotically simple spacetime, there may be different
(non overlapping) regions $\mathscr{U}$ satisfying the above property.
For instance we shall see in Chap.~\ref{s:ker}
that there are an infinite series of them in the Kerr spacetime.
\end{remark}

Finally one says that a spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$ is
\defin{asymptotically flat}\index{asymptotically!flat}\index{flat!asymptotically --}
(or more precisely \defin{weakly asymptotically simple and empty}\index{weakly!asymptotically simple and empty} \cite{HawkiE73})
iff $(\M,\w{g})$ is weakly asymptotically simple and the Ricci tensor of
$\w{g}$ vanishes in an open neighbourhood of $\scri$: $\w{R} = 0$.

\begin{example}
The de Sitter and anti-de Sitter spacetimes are asympotically simple but
are not asymptotically flat.
\end{example}

Penrose \cite{Penro65b} (see also \cite{Fraue04}) has shown that if $(\M,\w{g})$
is asymptotically simple and empty, that the Weyl tensor of $\w{g}$ (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:bas:Weyl})
vanishes at $\scri$. Since the
Ricci tensor is zero, this implies that the full Riemann curvature tensor vanishes
at $\scri$ [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:bas:Weyl})], hence the qualifier \emph{asymptotically flat}.

\section{Black holes} \label{s:glo:BH}

\subsection{Preliminaries regarding causal structure}

Before we proceed to the precise definition of a black hole, let us introduce
some concepts regarding the causal structure of a given spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$.
For any subset $S$ of $\M$, one defines
\begin{itemize}
\item the \defin{chronological future of $S$}\index{chronological!future} as the set $I^+(S)$ of all
points of $\M$ that can be reached from a point of $S$ by a future-directed
timelike curve of nonzero extent;
\item the \defin{causal future of $S$}\index{causal!future} as the set $J^+(S)$ of
all points that either are in $S$ or can be reached from a point of $S$ by a future-directed
causal curve;
\item the \defin{chronological past of $S$}\index{chronological!past} as the set $I^-(S)$ of all
points of $\M$ that can be reached from a point of $S$ by a past-directed
timelike curve of nonzero extent;
\item the \defin{causal past of $S$}\index{causal!past} as the set $J^-(S)$ of
all points that either are in $S$ or can be reached from a point of $S$ by a past-directed
causal curve.
\end{itemize}
From the above definitions, one has always $S \subset J^\pm(S)$ and
$I^\pm(S) \subset J^\pm(S)$.

\begin{remark}
One has not necessarily $S \subset I^\pm(S)$. For instance,
if the spacetime does not contain
any closed timelike curve, one has  $S \cap I^\pm(S) = \varnothing$ for
$S = \{p\}$ with $p$ any point of $\M$.
\end{remark}

Here are some basic topological properties of the future and past sets
defined above (see e.g. \S~6.2 of \cite{HawkiE73} or Chap.~14 of
\cite{ONeil83} for proofs):
\begin{itemize}
\item
$I^\pm(S)$ is always an open subset\footnote{This property is a direct
consequence of Lemma~1 in Sec.~\ref{s:glo:properties_H} below.} of $\M$, while
$J^\pm(S)$ is not necessarily a closed subset.
\item The interior of $J^\pm(S)$ is $I^\pm(S)$:
\be \label{e:glo:int_JS_IS}
    \mathrm{int}\, J^\pm(S) = I^\pm(S).
\ee
\item Both sets have the same closure:
\be \label{e:glo:clos_JS_IS}
    \overline{J^\pm(S)} = \overline{I^\pm(S)} .
\ee
\item
It follows from (\ref{e:glo:int_JS_IS}) and (\ref{e:glo:clos_JS_IS})
that both sets share the same boundary:
\be \label{e:glo:boundary_JS_IS}
    \partial J^\pm(S) = \partial I^\pm(S).
\ee
\end{itemize}

\subsection{General definition of a black hole} \label{s:glo:def_BH}

We are now in position to give the general definition of a black hole.
We shall do it for a spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$ that admits a conformal completion
at null infinity as defined in Sec.~\ref{s:glo:conf_compl} and thus
possesses a future null infinity $\scri^+$.
Moreover, we shall assume that $\scri^+$ is \defin{complete}\index{complete!future null infinity}: if $\scri^+$
is a null hypersurface, which occurs if $(\M,\w{g})$ is asymptotically flat,
this means that $\scri^+$ is generated by complete null geodesics.
The completeness condition is imposed to avoid ``spurious'' black holes,
such as black holes in Minkowski space (cf. Remark~\ref{s:glo:spurious_bh} below).
The neighbourhood of $\scri^+$
in $\tilde{\M}$ can then be considered as the infinitely far region
reached by outgoing null geodesics. If a null geodesic does not reach this
region, it can be considered as being trapped somewhere else in spacetime: this
``somewhere else'' constitutes the black hole region.

\begin{greybox}
Let $(\M,\w{g})$ be a spacetime with a conformal completion at null infinity
such that $\scri^+$ is complete;
the \defin{black hole region}\index{black!hole}, or simply \defin{black hole},
is the set of points of $\M$ that are not in the causal past of the future null infinity:
\be \label{e:glo:def_BH}
    \encadre{\mathscr{B} := \M \setminus (J^-(\scri^+)\cap\M) } .
\ee
(cf. Fig.~\ref{f:glo:def_bh}).
\end{greybox}
The black hole region is thus the set of points of $\M$
from which no future-directed causal curve in $\tilde{\M}$ reaches $\scri^+$.
Of course, it may be that $\mathscr{B} = \varnothing$, in which case one
says that the spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$ contains no black hole.


\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{glo_def_bh.pdf}}
\caption[]{\label{f:glo:def_bh} \footnotesize
The black hole region $\mathscr{B}$ defined as the complement of
the causal past of the future null infinity, $J^-(\scri^+)$.}
\end{figure}


\begin{example}
The Minkowski spacetime contains no black hole, for all future-directed null geodesics
terminate at $\scri^+$ (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:glo:conf_Mink_null}).
More generally, any asymptotically simple spacetime contains no black hole.
\end{example}

\begin{remark} \label{s:glo:spurious_bh}
If we release the assumption of $\scri^+$-completeness in the above definition,
we may end up with unphysical or ``spurious'' black holes.
For instance, let us consider the conformal completion of Minkowski spacetime
$(\M,\w{g})$ resulting from its embedding in the Einstein cylinder
$(\E,\w{\tilde{g}})$, as in
Sec.~\ref{s:glo:conf_complet_Mink},
keeping the same $\scri^-$ but
defining $\scri^+$ as the
hypersurface of $\E$ given by $\tau = \pi - \chi$
and $0<\tau<\pi/2$, instead of  $0<\tau<\pi$ in Sec.~\ref{s:glo:conf_complet_Mink}.
The manifold with boundary $\tilde{\M} := \M \cup \scri^+ \cup \scri^-$,
equipped with the Einstein cylinder metric $\w{\tilde g}$, is then a conformal completion
of $(\M,\w{g})$ at null infinity. With such a $\scri^+$, the black hole region
defined by (\ref{e:glo:def_BH}) is non-empty, as shown in Fig.~\ref{f:glo:spurious_bh}.
\end{remark}

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=0.3\textheight]{glo_spurious_bh.pdf}}
\caption[]{\label{f:glo:spurious_bh} \footnotesize
Spurious black hole region $\mathscr{B}$ in Minkowski spacetime resulting
from a conformal completion with a non-complete $\scri^+$.
Compare with Fig.~\ref{f:glo:conf_Mink_null}.}
\end{figure}



\begin{remark}
Some authors (in particular Hawking and Ellis \cite{HawkiE73}) define a
\emph{black hole} as a connected component of
$S(\tau) \cap \mathscr{B}$, where $S(\tau)$ is a spacelike
hypersurface that is a slice of the future development of a partial
Cauchy hypersurface $S(0)$ such that the
closure in $\tilde{\M}$ of the domain of dependence of $S(0)$ contains $\scri^+$.
According to such a definition, a black hole is a $(n-1)$-dimensional object,
while the black hole $\mathscr{B}$ defined above is a $n$-dimensional object.
\end{remark}

If $\mathscr{B}\not=\varnothing$, the boundary $\Hor$ of the black hole region
is called the \defin{future event horizon}\index{future!event horizon}
(or simply the \defin{event horizon}\index{event!horizon}
when no ambiguity may arise):
\be
    \encadre{\Hor := \partial \mathscr{B}}.
\ee
By pluging expression (\ref{e:glo:def_BH}) for $\mathscr{B}$ in the standard
identity $\partial \mathscr{B} =
\overline{\mathscr{B}} \cap \overline{\M\setminus \mathscr{B}}$, we get
an equivalent expression for $\Hor$:
\[
    \Hor = \overline{\M \setminus (J^-(\scri^+)\cap\M)} \cap
        \overline{(J^-(\scri^+)\cap\M)}
        = \partial(J^-(\scri^+)\cap\M) .
\]
Now, the boundary of $J^-(\scri^+)$ in $\tilde{\M}$ is
$\partial J^-(\scri^+) = \partial (J^-(\scri^+)\cap\M) \cup \scri^+$, so that
$\partial J^-(\scri^+) \cap \M =  \partial(J^-(\scri^+)\cap\M)$; hence
\be
    \encadre{\Hor = \partial J^-(\scri^+) \cap \M }.
\ee
In words: the future event horizon $\Hor$ is the part of the boundary of the causal past
of the future null infinity $\scri^+$ that lies in $\M$ (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:glo:def_bh}).
Note that thanks to identity (\ref{e:glo:boundary_JS_IS}), we can write as
well
\be
    \Hor = \partial I^-(\scri^+) \cap \M .
\ee

In a way symmetric to the black hole one, one defines
the \defin{white hole region}\index{white!hole} of a
spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$ with a conformal completion at null infinity as the
complement within $\M$ of the causal future of the past null infinity.
\be
    \encadre{\mathscr{W} := \M \setminus (J^+(\scri^-)\cap \M) } .
\ee
The white hole region is thus the set of points of $\M$
from which no past-directed causal curve in $\tilde{\M}$ reaches $\scri^-$.
The boundary of white hole region is called the
\defin{past event horizon}\index{past!event horizon}:
\be
    \encadre{\Hor^- := \partial \mathscr{W} = \partial J^+(\scri^-) \cap \M } .
\ee

The \defin{domain of outer communications}\index{domain!of outer communications}
is the part $\langle\langle \M\rangle\rangle$ of $\M$ that lies neither
in the black hole region nor in the white hole one:
\be
    \langle\langle \M\rangle\rangle := \M\setminus (\mathscr{B}\cup \mathscr{W} )
            = \left( J^-(\scri^+) \cap J^+(\scri^-) \right) \cap \M .
\ee
The last equality, which is a direct consequence of the definitions of
$\mathscr{B}$ and $\mathscr{W}$, shows that the domain of outer communications
is the set of points from which it is possible to send a signal to and to
receive a signal from arbitrary far regions.
It also follows immediately from the definitions of the two event horizons
that the boundary of the domain of outer communications is their union:
\be
    \partial \langle\langle \M\rangle\rangle  = \Hor \cup \Hor^- .
\ee

\begin{hist}
The term \emph{event horizon} has been introduced by W.~Rindler in 1956 \cite{Rindl56}
in the context of a single observer moving in some cosmological spacetime.
The word \emph{black hole} has been coined by J.A.~Wheeler in the end of 1967,
from a suggestion shouted from the audience during one of his conference.
It superseded the previous names
\emph{frozen star}, \emph{collapsed star}, or \emph{astre occlus}
(the latter appearing along \emph{black holes} in the title of
the proceedings of the famous Les Houches summer school of 1972 \cite{DeWit73}).
The expression \emph{domain of outer communications} is due to B.~Carter
(1971) \cite{Carte71}.
\end{hist}


\subsection{Properties of the future event horizon} \label{s:glo:properties_H}

Having defined a black hole in full generality, let us derive the
main properties of the black hole boundary: the event horizon $\Hor$.

\subsubsection{Property 1:}
\begin{greybox}
$\Hor$ is an \defin{achronal set}\index{achronal set}, i.e. no pair of points of $\Hor$ can be connected
by a timelike curve of $\M$.
\end{greybox}

Note that in the definition of an achronal set, it is not demanded that the timelike
curve lies entirely in the set (for instance, the set can be discrete, so that no curve
whatsoever lies in it). Accordingly,
an equivalent statement of Property~1 is: no timelike curve of $\M$
encounters $\Hor$ at more than one point.

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth]{glo_achronal.pdf}}
\caption[]{\label{f:glo:achronal} \footnotesize
Proving that $\Hor$ is achronal.}
\end{figure}

\begin{proof}
Let us assume the negation of Property~1, i.e. that there exists two points
in $\Hor$ which are connected by a timelike curve $\Li$. Let us call $p$ and
$q$ these two points, with $q$ in the future of $p$ (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:glo:achronal}).
We shall then use the following property:\\[1ex]
\textbf{Lemma 1}: One can ``move the ends'' of any timelike curve
``a little bit'' and still get a timelike curve. More precisely,
if two points $p,q\in\M$ are connected by a timelike curve,
there exists
a neighbourhood $U$ of $p$ and a neighbourhood $V$ of $q$ such that
any point $p'\in U$ can be connected to any point $q'\in V$ by a timelike curve.
\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma 1]
This is more or less evident on a spacetime diagram (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:glo:timelike_stab})
and a formal proof
can be found as Lemma~3
in Chap.~14 of O'Neill's textbook \cite{ONeil83}.
\end{proof}
Applying Lemma~1,
let us choose $p'\in U\cap\mathscr{B}$ and $q'\in V\cap J^-(\scri^+)$. Such a choice is
always possible since $p$ and $q$ lie on the boundary between $\mathscr{B}$
and $J^-(\scri^+)$ (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:glo:achronal}).
Since $q'\in J^-(\scri^+)$, the timelike curve linking $p'$ and $q'$ can then be extended in the future into a causal curve $\Li'$ reaching $\scri^+$. This implies $p'\in J^-(\scri^+)$,
which contradicts $p'\in\mathscr{B}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=0.3\textheight]{glo_timelike_stab.pdf}}
\caption[]{\label{f:glo:timelike_stab} \footnotesize
Lemma~1: moving slightly the ends $p$ and $q$ of a timelike curve $\Li$
yields another timelike curve $\Li'$.}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Property 2:}
\begin{greybox}
$\Hor$ is a topological manifold of dimension $n-1$, $n$ being the spacetime
dimension.
\end{greybox}

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{glo_hor_manifold.pdf}}
\caption[]{\label{f:glo:hor_manifold} \footnotesize
Proving that $\Hor$ is a topological manifold of dimension $n-1$.}
\end{figure}

\begin{proof}
Let $p\in\Hor$ and $U$ some open neighbourhood of $p$ where one can define
a normal coordinate system $(x^\alpha)$. We have then $\wpar_0$ timelike,
$\wpar_i$ spacelike for $i\in\{1,\ldots,n-1\}$ and $\w{g}(\wpar_0, \wpar_i) = 0$.
Let us consider a curve in $U$ defined by $x^1 = a_1$,..., $x^{n-1} = a_{n-1}$,
where $a_1$, ..., $a_{n-1}$ are $n-1$ constants.
This curve is timelike, since it has $\wpar_0$ as a tangent vector
(cf. Fig.~\ref{f:glo:hor_manifold}).
It therefore intersects $\Hor$ at a single point $q$, for $\Hor$ is achronal (Property~1).
Let us then give the coordinates $(y^i) = (a_1,\ldots,a_{n-1})$ to $q$.
By varying $(a_1,\ldots,a_{n-1})$, we get a homeomorphism from $U\cap\Hor$
to an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
Generically, the topological manifold $\Hor$ is not a smooth manifold, for it
contains some points (the crossovers defined below) at which it is not differentiable.
Actually $\Hor$ is slightly more than a mere topological submanifold of $\M$: it is a
\emph{Lipschitz submanifold} of $\M$. The latter is
intermediate between a topological submanifold, i.e.
a submanifold of class $C^0$ (continuous), and a differentiable submanifold of
class $C^1$. On $U\cap\Hor$, the function $x^0$ is a Lipschitz function
of the coordinates $(y^i)$: $\left|x^0(y^i) - x^0({y'}^i)\right| < K \sqrt{\sum_i (y^i - {y'}^i)^2}$.
This follows from the achronal character of $\Hor$: the points of coordinates
$(y^i)$ and $({y'}^i)$ cannot have a too large separation in terms of $x^0$,
otherwise they would be timelike separated.
Hence, one says that $\Hor$ is a \defin{Lipschitz submanifold}\index{Lipschitz submanifold} of $\M$. The notation $C^{1-}$ (i.e. a kind of intermediate between
$C^0$ and $C^1$) is generally used to denote Lipschitz submanifolds.
\end{remark}

\subsubsection{Property 3 (Penrose 1968 \cite{Penro68}):}
\begin{greybox}
$\Hor$ is ruled by a family of null geodesics that (i) either lie entirely
in $\Hor$ or at least never leave $\Hor$ when followed into the future from the
point where they arrived in $\Hor$, and
(ii) have no endpoint in the future.
Moreover, there is exactly one null geodesic through each point of $\Hor$,
except at special points where null geodesics enter in contact with $\Hor$, which are
called \defin{crossovers}\index{crossover point}. A special case
of crossover, called \defin{caustic}\index{caustic}, is a point
where neighbouring null geodesics focus and converge while entering on $\Hor$.
\end{greybox}
In particular, once a null geodesic has
merged with $\Hor$ (at a point where it may intersect other null geodesics),
it will stay forever on $\Hor$ and will never intersect any other null geodesic
of the family ruling $\Hor$. These null geodesics are called the
\defin{generators of}\index{generator!of an event horizon} $\Hor$.
The set of all crossovers is called the \defin{crease set}\index{crease set}
\cite{Siino98a,Siino98b,Brill14}.

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{glo_timelike_arc.pdf}}
\caption[]{\label{f:glo:timelike_arc} \footnotesize
Lemma 2: A \emph{causal} curve $\Li$ containing a timelike segment (between
$a$ and $b$ on the figure) can be deformed into a \emph{timelike} curve $\Li'$
with the ends kept fixed (dashed curve).}
\end{figure}


\begin{proof}
The following proof is adapted from that presented in Box~34.1 of MTW \cite{MisneTW73}.
It relies on the following lemma:\\[1ex]
\textbf{Lemma~2:} Let $\Li$ be a causal curve connecting two points $p$ and $q$
of $\M$. If $\Li$ contains a timelike segment, then there exists an
entirely timelike curve connecting $p$ and $q$.
\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma 2]
We shall provide only a graphical ``proof'', based on the spacetime diagram
of Fig.~\ref{f:glo:timelike_arc}. The causal curve $\Li$ may have parts where it is null (segments $pq$ and $bq$ in Fig.~\ref{f:glo:timelike_arc}); these parts are drawn with
an angle of incline $\theta = \pm 45^\circ$.
If $\Li$ contains a timelike segment (as $ab$ in Fig.~\ref{f:glo:timelike_arc}), i.e. a segment with $|\theta|>45^\circ$,
it can be deformed, while keeping the same ends, to a curve with $|\theta|>45^\circ$
everywhere, i.e. to a timelike curve.
\end{proof}


\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth]{glo_point_sequence.pdf}}
\caption[]{\label{f:glo:point_sequence} \footnotesize
Causal curve $\Li$ connecting $p$ to $q$ obtained as a limit of causal curves
in $J^-(\scri^+)$.}
\end{figure}


Let $p\in\Hor$ and let $U$ be some convex open neighbourhood of $p$.
Since $p$ lies in the boundary of $J^-(\scri^+)$, it is always possible to
consider
a sequence of points $(p_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ converging toward $p$
and such that $\forall n\in\mathbb{N},\ p_n \in U \cap J^-(\scri^+)$
(cf. Fig.~\ref{f:glo:point_sequence}).
Since $p_n\in J^-(\scri^+)$,
there exists a future-directed causal curve $\Li_{n}$ from $p_n$ to $\scri^+$
for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$.
The neighbourhood $U$ being convex, each $\Li_n$ intersects its boundary $\partial U$
at a unique point, $q_n$ say: $\{q_n\}=\Li_n \cap \partial U$
(cf. Fig.~\ref{f:glo:point_sequence}).
Since $\partial U$
is compact, the sequence $(q_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ admits a subsequence,
$(q_{f(n)})_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ say ($f$ being an increasing
function $\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$),
that converges to some limit point $q$.
Since from any point $p_{f(n)}$ arbitrary close to $p$, there is
the causal curve $\Li_{f(n)}$ to the point $q_{f(n)}$ arbitrary close to $q$,
one can show that
there exists a causal curve $\Li$ connecting $p$ to $q$
(cf. Fig.~\ref{f:glo:point_sequence}; see e.g.
Lemma~6.2.1 of Hawking \& Ellis textbook \cite{HawkiE73}
for a precise demonstration).

As the limit of points in $J^-(\scri^+)$, $q$ lies in the closure
$\overline{J^-(\scri^+)} = J^-(\scri^+) \cup \Hor$, $\Hor$
being the boundary of $J^-(\scri^+)$.
Let us show by contradiction that actually $q\in\Hor$.
If we assume $q\not\in\Hor$, then necessarily $q\in J^-(\scri^+)$.
There exists then an open neighbourhood $V$ of $q$ such that $V \subset  J^-(\scri^+)$
(cf. Fig.~\ref{f:glo:q_in_H}).
Let us choose $q'\in V$ such that $q$ is connected to $q'$ via a timelike curve.
We may then extend $\Li$ to a causal curve $\tilde{\Li}$ from $p$ to $\scri^+$
via $q$ and $q'$ (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:glo:q_in_H}). Since $\tilde{\Li}$ contains a timelike segment
(between $q$ and $q'$), we may invoke Lemma~2 to deform it into
a timelike curve $\tilde{\Li}'$ between $p$ and $\scri^+$. Then, by Lemma~1,
one can ``move the past end'' of $\tilde{\Li}'$
to get a new timelike curve $\tilde{\Li}''$ linking an event $p'\in\mathscr{B}$ close
to $p$ to $\scri^+$ (dotted curve in Fig.~\ref{f:glo:q_in_H}), which is impossible by the very definition of the black hole
region $\mathscr{B}$. Hence we have that $q\in\Hor$.

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth]{glo_q_in_H.pdf}}
\caption[]{\label{f:glo:q_in_H} \footnotesize
Proving by contradiction that $q$ lies in $\Hor$.}
\end{figure}


The causal curve $\Li$ connecting $p$ to $q$ cannot be timelike since
$p$ and $q$ are both in $\Hor$, which is achronal (Property~1).
If $\Li$ would contain a timelike segment, then by Lemma~2, it could
be deformed into a timelike curve between $p$ and $q$, which again would
contradict the achronal character of $\Hor$. Hence $\Li$ is necessarily a null
curve. If it would not be a null geodesic, it would not have an extremum length
between all curves connecting $p$ and $q$ (the length being defined as
the integral of the scalar square $\D s^2 = \w{g}(\D\w{x}, \D\w{x})$
of the displacement vector $\D\w{x}$ along the curve).
The length of $\Li$ being zero, there would then exist some curves of negative
length connecting $p$ and $q$. Since such curves are timelike, this
would be in contradiction with the achronal character of $\Hor$.

At this stage, we have shown that given $p\in\Hor$, there exists
a future-directed null geodesic $\Li$ connecting $p$ to another point $q\in\Hor$.
There remains to show that $\Li$ lies entirely in $\Hor$.
Let us start by showing that $\Li\subset \overline{J^-(\scri^+)}$.
Let $a$ be a generic point of $\Li$ between $p$ and $q$. Since $\Li$ is
null, there exists a point
$a'$ arbitrary close to $a$ such that $a'$ is connected to $q$ by a
future-directed timelike curve (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:glo:L_in_H}). Thanks to Lemma~1
and the property $q\in \overline{J^-(\scri^+)}$, we may
find a point $q'\in J^-(\scri^+)$ close to $q$ such that $a'$ is connected
to $q'$ by a future-directed timelike curve.
Since $q'\in J^-(\scri^+)$, such a curve can be extended
to a causal curve to $\scri^+$  (the dashed curve
in Fig.~\ref{f:glo:L_in_H}); hence
$a'\in  J^-(\scri^+)$. Since $a'$ is arbitrary close to $a$, we conclude
that $a\in\overline{J^-(\scri^+)}$.
This property being valid for any point $a\in \Li$, we have
shown in fact that $\Li\subset \overline{J^-(\scri^+)} = J^-(\scri^+)\cup \Hor$.
Now it is easy to show that any point $a$ of $\Li$ actually lies in $\Hor$
by repeating exactly the same reasoning as that employed above to show that
$q\in\Hor$, by replacing $q$ by $a$. We therefore conclude that
$\Li$ lies entirely in $\Hor$.

\end{figure}



Given a point $p\in\Hor$, we have thus constructed a
future-directed null geodesic $\Li$ lying entirely in $\Hor$ and
connecting $p$ to another point $q\in\Hor$. One can
repeat the construction
from the point $q$ to get another future-directed null geodesic $\Li'\subset\Hor$
connecting $q$ to another point $q'\in\Hor$. Now $\Li$ and $\Li'$ must
be two segments of the same null geodesic $\Li\cup\Li'$ by the following lemma:\\[1ex]
\textbf{Lemma~3}: If from a point $q\in\Hor$, there exists a past-directed
null geodesic $\Li\subset\Hor$ and a future-directed null geodesic $\Li'\subset\Hor$,
then necessarily $\Li$ and $\Li'$ have collinear tangent vectors at their common point $q$.
It follows that $\Li$ (with a time-reversed parametrization) and $\Li'$ are two segments
of a same null geodesic through $q$.

\caption[]{\label{f:glo:unique_geod} \footnotesize
Proof of Lemma~3.}
\end{figure}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma 3]
Assume that $\Li$ and $\Li'$ have non-collinear tangent vectors at $q$. Then, in
the vicinity of $q$, one can find a point $a\in\Li$ and a point $b\in\Li'$
such that $a$ and $b$ can be connected by a timelike curve (cf.
Fig.~\ref{f:glo:unique_geod}). Since $\Li\subset\Hor$ and $\Li'\subset\Hor$, we have $a\in\Hor$ and
$b\in\Hor$ and therefore we get a contradiction with $\Hor$ being achronal.
\end{proof}
Thanks to Lemma~3, we conclude that $\Li'$ extends $\Li$ to null geodesic
$\Li\cup\Li'$ entirely lying in $\Hor$. By iterating, we conclude that
the null geodesic $\Li$ through $p$ can be extended indefinitely into the
future. Moreover, it can never leave $\Hor$. Indeed, if it leaves $\Hor$ at
some point $q$, by the same procedure used above for $p$, one could construct a future-directed null geodesic
$\Li'\subset\Hor$ starting from $q$ and Lemma~3 would imply that
the extension of $\Li$ outside $\Hor$ has to coincide with $\Li'$, which is
in contradiction with $\Li'\subset\Hor$.

Another direct consequence of Lemma~3 is that no two distinct null generators
may intersect at a point $p\in\Hor$, except if their segments in the past of
$p$ lie outside $\Hor$.
This completes the proof of Property~3.
\end{proof}

Some features of Property~3 are illustrated in Fig.~\ref{f:glo:BH_headon_gener},
which displays the null geodesic generators in a numerical simulation
of the head-on collision of two black holes by Matzner et al. (1995) \cite{Matzn_al95}.
Note that new null geodesics enter in the event horizon at the ``crotch'' of the
``pair of pants''.

The head-on black hole merger has been also computed by Cohen et al. (2009) \cite{CohenPS09}, with an increase numerical accuracy (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:glo:EH_headon_3d}).
Cross-sections of the event horizon $\Hor$ (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:def:spacelike_sections})
are depicted in Fig.~\ref{f:glo:EH_headon}. The same figure shows also how
some null geodesics will reach $\Hor$ to become null generators.

The blue curves are null geodesics that will eventually become null generators

Each figure is a 2D cut of a hypersurface $\Sigma_t$ defined by a constant
value of the coordinate time $t$, expressed in units of the sum $M$ of the initial irreducible masses of each black
hole (cf. Sec.~??). The whole 3D hypersurface $\Sigma_t$ can be reconstructed
by rotation around the collision axis.
$t_{\rm CEH}$ (for ``Common Event Horizon'')
is the coordinate time at which the cross-section of $\Hor$ becomes a connected
2-surface.
The cross-sections of $\Hor$ are displayed
in black, while the green dashed curves denote the set of the intersections
with $\Sigma_t$ of the null geodesics that
will become null generators $\Hor$ through the cusps in the
``individual'' event horizons.
The red and blue dashed curves denotes apparent horizons (cf. Sec.~??).

Finally, Fig.~\ref{f:glo:EH_binspir} shows a cross-section
of the event horizon computed by Cohen et al. (2012) \cite{CohenKS12}
in some inspiralling binary black hole merger. The
black hole spacetime itself has been computed as a solution of the vaccum
Einstein equation by Scheel at al. \cite{ScheeBCKMP09}; it corresponds to
16 inspiralling orbits of a equal-mass binary black hole with vanishing initial
spins.

by surfaces of constant coordinate time $t$
(source: Fig.~2 of Ref.~\cite{CohenKS12}; \copyright 2012 American Physical Society).}
\end{figure}

Generically, for a binary black hole merger,
the crease set forms a 2-dimensional subset of the event horizon
$\Hor$ and is bounded by the set of caustic points, which forms a 1-dimensional
subset of $\Hor$ \cite{Siino98a,Siino98b,HusaW99,CohenKS12}.

\subsubsection{Property 4:}
\begin{greybox}
Wherever it is smooth, $\Hor$ is a null hypersurface.
\end{greybox}
\begin{proof}
Let us assume that $\Hor$ is smooth in some open subset $U$.
By Property~2, $\Hor$ is then a smooth hypersurface in $U$.
According to Property~3, there is a null geodesic lying in $\Hor$ through
any point of $\Hor\cap U$.
This implies null tangent vectors at any point of $\Hor\cap U$, so that, in $U$,
$\Hor$ must be either a null hypersurface or a timelike one. But $\Hor$ is achronal by Property~1 and therefore cannot be timelike. Hence $\Hor$ is a null hypersurface in $U$.
\end{proof}
When $\Hor$ is smooth, its generators,
as defined in Property~3, are then nothing but the
null-hypersurface generators as defined in Sec.~\ref{s:def:geod_gener}.

\begin{remark}
Properties 1 to 4 are not specific to black hole horizons: they are actually
valid for any boundary $\partial J^-(S)$ of the causal past of a given set $S\subset\M$.
They are also valid for the boundary $\partial J^+(S)$ of the causal future of
$S$, modulo the relevant changes future $\leftrightarrow$ past in Property~3.
\end{remark}

It can be shown that event horizons are smooth almost everywhere: the only
location where they are not differentiable is the crease set, i.e. the set of points
where null geodesics cross each other while arriving at $\Hor$ and becoming null
generators.
